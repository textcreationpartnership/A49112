         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have already writ a Book ſo much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than I at firſt deſigned it, that I ſhall not trouble my Readers with a long Preface. I have careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, and I think, have fully anſwered, all that I could think material in my Adverſaries Objections. I can honeſtly ſay this for my ſelf, that I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooked nothing, becauſe I thought it difficult to return a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Anſwer to it, though, I confeſs, I have ſlighted ſome trifling Objections, as unworthy of an Anſwer. Had I been mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb facs="tcp:93053:3"/>diſpoſed, I could have given my Readers great Diverſion, by expoſing the folly of Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> a very bold, but a very ignorant Writer. But I thought it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thing to inſult and triumph over ſo mean an Adverſary, and an unpardonable affront to the judgment of Mankind, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to prove, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> did not begin the War againſt the King; that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, by their unreaſonable Oppoſition to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> give great advantage to the Papiſts to accompliſh their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: That the Papiſts are hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Enemies to the Order of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and would gladly deſtroy the Proteſtant Epiſcopacy: That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory was not inclined to Popery, nor deſigned to reduce the Church of <hi>England</hi> to a nearer
<pb facs="tcp:93053:3"/>Conformity to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I did preſume, that all Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s Wit or Sophiſtry, could never perſwade the <hi>Engliſh</hi> World to believe otherwiſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it to no purpoſe to ſpend Ink and Paper, and ſome precious hours in ſo needleſs a Work. As for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the grave and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reprimand, which Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> gives the Dean for it) I am mightily inclined to pity him; he has diſputed himſelf out of all ſence, and all good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and I think there is the leaſt Reaſon to anſwer his Books, of any man's I know, for I believe very few People underſtand what he would have himſelf, or what there is in them to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; what his Name and Authority may do, I cannot tell, but I fancy, his meer Writings will never make any Proſelyte
<pb facs="tcp:93053:4"/>one way or other. However I have conſidered, whatever I could judge worth anſwering, and have been at more trouble to find out what his Objection was, than to find an Anſwer to it.</p>
            <p>He has been pleaſed to give me a Name, though I did not think fit to publiſh it my ſelf, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he gueſs right or wrong, he ſhall never know from me. And yet, as I remember, the Country Conformiſt blames me for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi>'s Names, becauſe they had not owned them themſelves, though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had done it for them. But it was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to publiſh my Name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he could give a Hiſtory of my Life too, which, I thank God, has been at leaſt to outward appearance, ſo innocent, that if he knew me, I fear not his moſt malicious and ſpiteful Comments.
<pb facs="tcp:93053:4"/>I ſhall only tell him, that Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> whom I know very well, preſents his ſervice to him, and aſſures him, that he can tell a more pleaſant ſtory of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures at <hi>Acton,</hi> and the Hiſtory of the Letter, than he has done, but is not willing to ſet up the Trade of writing Intelligences, nor concerning the World, in all the Privacies of Converſation. Only he wonders, what Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had, either to Print <hi>his own Letter,</hi> which had been ſufficiently anſwered long ſince,<note place="margin">Defence of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</note> or to Print his Letter, which contained ſo little Ceremony or Complement to him; it being the firſt time, that he remembers, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> guilty of Printing any private Lerter, which did not groſly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. In ſhort, that Doctor aſſures him, that if he have a mind to revive that old Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
<pb facs="tcp:93053:5"/>which his other Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have been pleaſed to forget, he is contented to enter the Liſts once more.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only further acquaint my Readers, that I have taken all the care I can, that they ſhall not wholly loſe their time, if they pleaſe to peruſe this Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for I have ſought all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of uſeful Diſcourſe, and have found many. And would but my Adverſaries read this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with as great freedom and impartiality, as I uſed in writing it, poſſibly we might in time ſee an end of theſe Controverſies, in a happy Union of Proteſtants, in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>IN my Defence of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Unreaſonableneſs of Separation, I have aſſerted (and proved, for any thing I ſee yet objected to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) that Chriſt has but one Church on Earth, and that the Unity of this Church conſiſts in one <hi>Catholick</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> inſtead of giving a fair Anſwer
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93053:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>to this, have endeavoured to affix ſuch a ſenſe on my words, as I never thought of, nay, as is directly contrary to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Doctrine of that Book; and when they have turned every thing into non-ſenſe and confuſion by their own ſenſeleſs Comments, they ſet up a great Cry of <hi>Caſſandrianiſm</hi> and Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>For my part, when I read thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations theſe Men had made of my Notions, I wondred to find my ſelf ſuch a ſtranger to my ſelf. I was perfectly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the whole buſineſs and Intrigue, and began to examine, whether I had expreſſed any thing ſo unwarily, as to lead them into ſuch Miſtakes; but upon inquiry, I found, it was nothing but the laſt weak Efforts of a dying Cauſe, like the works and doublings of a Hare, when ſhe is near run down, to loſe the Scent. For this is the conſtant Artifice of theſe men, when they are no longer able to defend their Cauſe, to ſtart aſide, and by one Art or other, to looſe their firſt Queſtion in ſome new Diſpute. Thus Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us for a Concluſion, <hi>I intend, God willing, hereafter to let the Matters of meer Conformity comparatively alone, and farther to examine this fundamental
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93053:10"/>Difference, ſeeing it is evident, that now Satan's deſign is to call the French Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery by the name of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</hi> p. 230.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Proteſtant Religion of the true Church of</hi> England <hi>by the name of Non-conformity and Schiſm, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſimple by a noiſe against the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Epiſcopacy, Liturgy, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; but that noiſe ſhall no more divert me from oppoſing the Foundations of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi> And I mightily commend the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Reſolution; for it is an eaſier matter to pull down a man of Clouts of his own ſetting up, then to uphold ſuch a decayed and ruinous Cauſe</p>
               <p>But I am reſolved not to loſe the Cauſe thus, and therefore ſhall beat a little backward, till we find it again, and ſhall 1. mind my Readers of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that Diſcourſe of Church-Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Communion. 2. Give a brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Doctrine of the defence in thoſe Points, and conſider their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Exceptions againſt it, and thoſe perverſe ſenſes they put upon my words, to form them into a <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p n="1">§. 1. I ſhall mind my Readers of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that Diſcourſe concerning

To ſhew how vain all thoſe projects were of uniting Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out curing their Separation, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s is, of making all ſeparate Churches parts of the National Church, by vertue of an Act of Parliament, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King, as the Accidental Head of ſuch an Accidental Church: For if the Church muſt be but one, and the Unity of this one Church conſiſts in one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, it is impoſſible in the nature of the thing, for all the power in the World, to make ſo many ſeparate Churches one Church. The ſupreme Power may grant equal Liberties and Priviledges in the Common-wealth to all theſe ſeparate Churches, but it can no more make them one, than it can make Contradictions to be true, the ſin and evil of Separation ſtill remains, the removal of which is the only thing that makes Union ſo deſirable; and if an Act of Parliament could do this, I confeſs the Propoſal would be conſiderable. If the evil and ſinfulneſs of Separation conſiſted only in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to humane Laws, I ſhould think it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93053:11"/>a barbarous thing to make any Laws, which ſhall enſnare men in ſo great a guilt: And it is impoſſible in ſuch an Age as this, which is diſtracted with ſo many different and contrary Perſwaſions, to make any Laws about Religion, which will meet with an univerſal compliance. But if the evil of Separation conſiſts in dividing the unity of the Church, which no Laws can cure, but thoſe which cure Separation, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s uniting Law can give no eaſe and ſecurity to the Souls and Conſciences of men, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may do to their Liberties and Eſtates: And I take the Souls of men to be of greater concernement, than their Bodies and Eſtates, and therefore ſhould challenge the principal regard from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious men in their Projects of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another deſign of that Diſcourſe of Church-Unity and Communion, was to give us the moſt plain and eaſie Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Schiſm and Separation, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and ſome other late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have induſtriouſly endeavoured to confound, that no body might know what it is. Now if there be but one Catholick Church all the World over, then every Separation is a Schiſm on one
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93053:12"/>ſide or other; for where there are two ſeparate Churches, one, if not both, muſt be ſchiſmatical, becauſe there is but one Church: And if the Unity of this Church conſiſts in one Communion, which exacts a joynt diſcharge of all the Duties of a Church-relation, in hearing, and praying, and receiving the Lord's Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together, then to forſake the Church, and meet in private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, in diſtinct and oppoſite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions for Religious Worſhip, is Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and when it is cauſeleſs, is a Schiſm, as I particularly proved in the defence from St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defence. p. 24<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> and St. <hi>Augustin;</hi> this was the ancient Notion of Schiſm. But if there be more than one Church and one Communion; if the Catholick Church conſiſt of all the ſeparate Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es all the World over,<note place="margin">Anſwer. to Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</hi> p. 132.</note> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> aſſerts, I would gladly know what Schiſm and Separation is, which hath ſo ill a Character in Scripture, and which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers ſo vehemently declaim againſt, as one of the greateſt Impieties, ſuch a wickedneſs as Martyrdom it ſelf cannot expiate.</p>
               <p>For if there be not one Church, but a great many Churches of diſtinct and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Communions, thoſe Chriſtians,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93053:12"/>who forſake one Church, and form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a new Church ſociety, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to divide the Church, but to multiply it, they become a diſtinct Church by themſelves; and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the Eſſentials of Chriſtian Faith and Worſhip, are as good and ſound a part of the Catholick Church, as that particular Church is, from which they ſeparate: For when there is no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Chriſtians to live in one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, what ſhould hinder them, if they pleaſe, from dividing into many?</p>
               <p>If there be more Churches and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions than one, he who forſakes one Church, and joyns in Communion with another, cannot be ſaid to go, or to be out of the Church, but only to remove from one Church to another; and yet this was the ancient Character of a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, that he was <hi>Extra Eccleſiam foris, one who is out of the Church without doors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cypr. de imitate.</note> and is ſaid, <hi>de eccleſia recedere, to go out of the Church.</hi> But according to this Notion, it is impoſſible for a man to go out of the Church, unleſs he forſake the Communion of all the Churches in the World: Nay, if Church-unity does not conſiſ tin one Communion, he may do that too, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſays the Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93053:13"/>do, and yet while they believe in Chriſt, continue members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</p>
               <p>Take away the Notion of one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and there are but two things, that I can think of, whereon to found the charge of Schiſm and Separation: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. on a private Contract and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between the Paſtor and Members of a particular Church; or, 2. on the Authority of the Magiſtrate, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns us to communicate with ſuch a Church. But now I obſerve firſt, that the Notion of Schiſm was antecedent to both theſe: The ancient Church knew no other Church-covenant but Baptiſm, which obliges us to Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and had no Chriſtian Magiſtrates for three hundred years to enforce or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn any Communion: And yet the Church never had a greater ſence of the evil of Schiſm in any Age, and therefore did believe Schiſm to be a very evil thing, without any regard to private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts or humane Authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To break our Promiſe and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is a great evil, but it is not in its own nature Schiſm, unleſs there be ſomething elſe to make it ſo, beſides breach of promiſe. To diſobey our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93053:13"/>in lawful things is a very great evil, but it is not in it ſelf the evil of Schiſm, but of diſobedience to lawful Authority: Theſe do greatly aggravate the ſin of Schiſm, when men are guilty of it, but it cannot make that to be Schiſm which is not; and yet there is no ſuch ſin, and can be no ſuch ſin as Schiſm, if there be not one Church; but men may divide into as many diſtinct and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Churches, as they pleaſe; for if any man ſhould ſay, that Separation is ſinful, when there is no juſt cauſe or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for Separation, this ſuppoſes that there are neceſſary reaſons againſt Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when there are no juſt reaſons for it; and I would gladly hear, what thoſe reaſons are againſt Separation, when you have deſtroyed the Notion of one Catholick Communion. But I have diſcourſed at large the uſe of this Notion of Catholick Communion, in the Diſputes of Schiſm and Separation, in the defence of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of Separation, <hi>ch.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 231. and thither I refer my Reader.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall hence briefly obſerve two things, with reference to my preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. 1. That the whole force of my reaſoning aginſt Separation in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93053:14"/>of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> depends on the Doctrine of one Catholick Communion; and therefore I was not at all concerned to aſſert <hi>one viſible unifying Church-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er under Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</hi> p. 181.</note> over all the Catholick Church, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls it. I no where throughout my Book oppoſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, upon the Principles of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal unifying Church-Power, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Principles of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and therefore neither having any where aſſerted any ſuch thing, nor having any reaſon to do ſo in the ſervice of the Cauſe I undertook, eſpecially having aſſerted the quite contrary, (as in due time will appear) the Reader may eaſily perceive how injuriouſly my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries have diſtorted my words, to give ſome colour and pretence to their Calumnies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I obſerve farther, That ſuppoſing there had ſome dubious paſſages about an univerſal Church-Power ſlipt from my Pen, the confuting ſuch a fancy as that, is by no means a confutation of the Defence. If the doctrine of one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion hold good, as it will certainly do, whatever becomes of Catholick Church-Power, it confounds all their little Excuſes and Apologies for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93053:14"/>Separation, and they are as very Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, as ever the <hi>Novatians</hi> or <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> were. Here the Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan about the ſinfulneſs of Separation; very angry they were, and gave a great many hard words to that excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who warned them of the danger and evil of it; many Books have been written about it, and now they are charged as high as ever, and are ferret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their Retreats, and ſee the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foundations of their Cauſe rooted up; all on a ſudden they grow tame and gentle, and patiently hear themſelves proved Schiſmaticks, without ſaying a word for themſelves, being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, it ſeems, to oppoſe a French Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery (which ſometimes, by what figure I know not, they call a <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign) than to vindicate their own dear ſelves from the charge of Schiſm. Some poſſibly may think them very mortified and ſelf-denying men; others will be tempted to ſuſpect ſome other Cauſe: But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is reſolved <hi>that noiſe ſhall not divert him from oppoſing the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Popery;</hi> the plain meaning of which is this, He finds it troubleſom to write in a Cauſe, where he is likely to find ſome pert young Doctors to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93053:15"/>him, and therefore is reſolved for the future to diſpute by himſelf, where he is ſecure of the victory, unleſs <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> and <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould happen to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; he having now Printed a Book in Quarto of 230 pages, as a Preparatory to a fuller Treatiſe; I ſuppoſe he means a fourth Folio, he telling us that he has writ three already.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. I come now to give a plain and brief account of the Doctrine of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence concerning <hi>one Catholick Church, and one Catholick Communion,</hi> which my Adverſaries have ſo induſtriouſly miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, that it is neceſſary to ſet it in a new Light.</p>
               <p>In the third Chapter I proved at large,<note place="margin">Defence ch. 3. p. 137. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> that Chriſt has but one Church, which is his Body and Spouſe, which we call the Catholick Church; and I do not find any of my Adverſaries hardy enough to deny the name of one Catholick Church, though it will appear in due time, that they deny the thing.</p>
               <p>That the Church is but one, I proved from the expreſs Teſtimony of Scripture, and the ancient Fathers, and by this unanſwerable Argument,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 151. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church is not a new Church, but the old <hi>Jewiſh</hi>-Church, reformed and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93053:15"/>ſpiritualized by the Laws and Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt; Chriſtianity being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but myſtical Judaiſm. The believing <hi>Jews</hi> continue ſtill united to their own Root, and the believing <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> are grafted on the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Root, and become one Church with them, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17, 18, 24. The middle Wall of Partition was broken down, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> received into the Church of God, which was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be confined within the bounds of <hi>Jury,</hi> nor to the carnal Seed and Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to ſpread it ſelf over all the World; and therefore ſince the Chriſtian Church is not a new Church, but built upon the old foundations of the Jewiſh Church, enlarged and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianized, it muſt continue as much one, as ever the Jewiſh Church was.</p>
               <p>I obſerved alſo from St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (whoſe words I had cited at large) <q>that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,<note place="margin">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93053:16"/>before its Branches, and the Fountain before the Rivers that flow from it; that particular Churches are made by the encreaſe and propagation of the Catholick Church, not the Catholick Church by the propagation of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> gives us the firſt taſte of his great underſtanding and skill in Controverſie, and what a formidable Adverſary he is like to prove. He ſays, <hi>I aſſert,</hi>

                  <hi>that the univerſal Church is in order of nature antecedent to particular Churches</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid <hi>Catholick,</hi> for that was my word; but then he had loſt his Metaphyſical ſubtilty about Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſals, of which more preſently) well, what hurt is there in that aſſertion? why firſt, the Alluſions I uſe for the illuſtration of this, of <hi>the Sun being before its Beams, and the Root before its Branches, and a Fountain before its Rivers, are not</hi> ad rem (that is, not to the purpoſe, nor to the Matter in hand; for I know not what force <hi>Engliſh</hi> Readers may imagine to be concealed in, <hi>ad rem,</hi> unleſs I tranſlate it) but he knew very well, that theſe are not my Alluſions (as he calls them) but St. <hi>Cyprians',</hi> whoſe Authority is much more conſiderable. But ſuppoſe they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93053:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>had been my own (as I ſee no Reaſon to be aſhamed of them) what is their fault? why, <hi>I ſhould have given ſome inſtance of ſome one <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, that was in order of nature antecedent to its Particulars.</hi> Now ſuppoſe I think, that the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Root,</hi> and <hi>Fountain,</hi> are ſuch Univerſals, with reſpect to their Beams, Branches, and Rivers; or ſuppoſe there were never an adaequate Example in nature of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Catholick Church, what were this, <hi>ad rem,</hi> if it appears, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church be ſuch an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal?</p>
               <p>Yes, if that could be proved indeed, it were ſomewhat to the purpoſe; but that, ſays Mr. <hi>Lob, is impoſſible, it being in the ſenſe of most, evident, that</hi> Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale <hi>is</hi> unum in multis, <hi>that is,</hi>

For, 2. the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church being an Univerſal, is no better than an <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> a meer Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Notion, and therefore muſt have its Being alſo in the <hi>Eutopian</hi> Common-wealth; I wiſh Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> does not at laſt prove the Creed, where we find the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, to be a meer <hi>Eutopian</hi> Common-wealth, for giving entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuch an <hi>Ens Rationis.</hi> Well,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93053:17"/>but Univerſals have a real exiſtence in particulars! right, but not as Univerſals, but as Particulars; humane nature has a real exiſtence in <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> becauſe they are all men; but humane nature conſidered as Univerſal, is in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, unleſs you will make as many Univerſal humane natures, as there are men in the World; thus there are a great many particular Churches actually exiſtent, but the Catholick Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as Catholick and Univerſal is a meer figment and notion, no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting but in <hi>Eutopia.</hi> And if this be all Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> means by his Univerſal Church, that it is a meer Logical notion, I readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, that he has not only proved, that Particular Churches are before the Univerſal Church, but that the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church has no actual Being at all, nor can ever have any, and therefore it is a vain thing to diſpute, which of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts firſt, when one of them does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt at all any where but in <hi>Eutopia.</hi> But all this is nothing to me, who never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled my head about the exiſtence of an <hi>Ens Rationis</hi> in a <hi>Fayry</hi> Land, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert ſuch an Univerſal Church, as has an actual being and exiſtence, which always is or may be viſible in the World, an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93053:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>Church, which is the object of Senſe, not the creature of fancy and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p>This I take to be the general ſenſe of all Chriſtians, of what Communion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, if they underſtand any thing of theſe matters, that the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church is a real thing which does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually exiſt; not as Logical Notions do, but as a Church and Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: For the Univerſal Church is the Body and the Spouſe of Chriſt, and it is a new fangled Hereſie to aſſert the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the Spouſe of Chriſt, to be an <hi>Ens Rationis;</hi> as the Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2+ letters">

               <p>Hitherto particular Churches have been acknowledged to be Members of the Univerſal Church, but no man in his Wits ever dream't before, that a thing which actually exiſts could be a Member of that, which has no real exiſtence, that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſuppoſe, or the Church of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould be Members of an imaginary Univerſal Church, which has no Being any where but in <hi>Eutopia:</hi> And therefore to help out our Author here, who has ſo miſerably loſt himſelf in Logick and Metaphyſicks; I obſerve,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93053:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>that the Catholick Church, is ſuch an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal as a whole is, with reſpect to its parts, not as a Species is, with reſpect to the Individuals contained under it; or to ſpeak more plain, as our natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is with reſpect to its particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, not as humane Nature is, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to particular men.</p>
               <p>And therefore the moſt common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aſſigned, both by Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divines, why the Church is called Catholick and Univerſal, is, not becauſe it is an univerſal Notion,<note place="margin">Neceſſario conſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, unam duntaxat eſſe Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, quam propterea Catholicam nuncupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, quod ſit <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalis, &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundatur per omnes mundi par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, &amp; ad omnia ſe tempora extendat, nullis vel locis incluſa vel tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus. <hi>Helv.</hi> conf. <hi>cap. 17.</hi>

               <p>Having thus redeemed the univerſal Church from its inviſible and imaginary State in the <hi>Eutopian</hi> Common-wealth, and brought it back into the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, let us now conſider how the Church

                  <note place="margin">p. 148.</note> If Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> does not underſtand this, I will endeavour to help him in it, if his Conſcience be not more incurable than his Underſtanding. For when I aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Catholick Church is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature antecedent to particular Churches; I expreſly declared, That I did not conſider the Catholick Church,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93053:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>as actually ſpread over all the World, but <hi>as the Root and Fountain of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> As St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did: For in this Senſe of the word <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> as it ſignifies, the Chriſtian Church diffuſed and propagated in all parts of the World, it is abſurd and ſenſeleſs to affirm, That the Church was Planted in all the World, before it was Planted in any one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but I placed the Catholiciſm of the Chriſtian Church, not meerly in its actual Extent, but in its intrinſick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; its Extent varies in ſeveral Ages, according to the Progreſs or Decreaſe of Chriſtianity in the World, but the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Church is always the ſame, be its Extent more or leſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catholick,</hi> indeed is a Name, which we do not find given to the Church in Scripture, nor in the moſt ancient Creeds; but we find in Scripture, that Chriſt has but one Church, and the very Nature and Conſtitution of this Church is ſuch, That it was not to be confined to any one Countrey, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was,<note place="margin">Defence, p. 147.</note> but to diffuſe and propagate it ſelf all the World over; and upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as I proved in the Defence, it is called the Catholick Church, becauſe though it be ſpread all the World over,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93053:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>it is but one Church ſtill. That very Church, which the Apoſtles firſt planted in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and by degrees enlarged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all parts of the World. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Church at its firſt Planting, when the beginnings of it were but ſmall, and when it overſpread ſo great a part of the World, is like the difference between a Child new Born, and when he is come to his full Growth and Stature, he is the ſame Perſon ſtill but increaſed in all parts, without divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one Member from another, or multiplying it ſelf into more Bodies; or like a Grain of Muſtard-Seed, which from ſmall beginnings grows into a large Tree. The Catholick or univerſal Church is that one Church, which is the one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, which was the ſame Church, when in the beginnings of Chriſtianity, it was confined to a ſingle Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and when it had ſpread it ſelf over all the World.</p>
               <p>I would deſire to know, whether Chriſt had ever more than one Church, and one Body? If he had not, Whether that one Church might not always be properly called the Catholick Church? If it might not, Then if Chriſt have a Catholick Church now, and formerly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93053:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>had no Catholick Church, he has a Church now which he had not at firſt; and therefore has either changed the Church, which he once had, or has two Churches; one which is not the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and another which is the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Church indeed has ſpread it ſelf into many parts of the World, where it was not at the firſt planting of the Goſpel, and therefore is more Catholick and Univerſal, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to its extent, than it was at firſt; but the Church, which is now ſpread all the World over, is but that one Church ſtill which began at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and therefore the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> while but one ſingle Congregation, was the Catholick Church in its Root, and Fountain, and principle of Unity, which was all that St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and I from him, affirmed of this Matter. And if parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches now may be Catholick Churches, as maintaining Catholick unity, which was the familiar Language of the primitive Fathers, much more might the firſt Chriſtian Church be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry properly called the Catholick Church, as being the Principle and Fountain of Catholick unity.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:93053:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But of all things I hate to diſpute about Words, and therefore if Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> will but grant the thing I contend for, let the Words ſhift for themſelves; and that is this, That the Church firſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtles in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is that one Church, which was afterwards ſpread over all the World; that when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles planted Churches in other Cities, Countries, and Provinces, they did not erect new diſtinct Independent Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but only enlarged that one Church of Chriſt, and added new Members to it. Let the Church of Chriſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be but one, which propagated it ſelf in the Unity of the ſame Body all the World over, and I have no farther Controverſie about this Matter.</p>
               <p>This is the only thing I was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, to prove that there is but one Church all the World over; and for this Reaſon, I aſſerted, <hi>That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church conſidered as the root and fountain of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, was in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture antecedent to particular Churches:</hi> The Catholick Church may ſubſiſt in one particular Church, otherwiſe the belief of the Catholick Church can be no neceſſary Article of our Creed, for the firſt Chriſtian Church, was the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93053:21"/>Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and if that were not in ſome ſenſe the Catholick Church, there was a Chriſtian Church, when there was no Catholick Church, and may be ſo again; if we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the World excepting one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, to apoſtatize from the Faith of Chriſt, which yet is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged poſſible to be.</p>
               <p>But if particular Churches were in order of Nature antecedent to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, then they muſt be true and compleat Churches, without any regard to Catholick unity, and then it is impoſſible ever after to find or make one Catholick Church. The Notion and Eſſence of the Catholick Church, as far as concerns this Controverſie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſuch a Catholick unity, as makes all the Chriſtians, and Chriſtian Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the World one Body and Church, and Members of each other. Now could we ſuppoſe that there were two or three or more particular Churches before the Catholick Church, as ſuppoſe the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> then we muſt acknowledg, that a Church may be a true compleat Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to Catholick unity, and then Catholick unity is not neceſſary to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93053:22"/>the Notion and Being of a Church, and then there can be no neceſſity of one Catholick Church. If it is poſſible, that there ſhould be two Chriſtian Churches, which are not of the ſame Communion, nor Members of each other, then why not a hundred, a thouſand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then there can be no one Catholick Church of Chriſts Inſtitution, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there may be by humane Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Confederacies.</p>
               <p>The Sum of all is this, Chriſt in the Inſtitution of his Church, deſigned but one Church all the World over, which we call the Catholick Church. This Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church muſt of neceſſity have a beginning ſomewhere, as, <hi>De facto,</hi> it had at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> where-ever this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is, there is the Root and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Catholick unity, becauſe all other Chriſtians, and Churches, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards embrace the Chriſtian Faith, are added to this Church, and received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Unity of this one Body; and it is impoſſible, that any man ſhould be a Chriſtian, or any Society of men a Chriſtian Church, who are not received into the Unity of this Church, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſuch a particular Church, but as the beginning of the Catholick Church;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93053:22"/>and thus all particular Churches are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to one another, and by vertue of this Catholick union, are one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. He who carefully conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this, will ſee what Reaſon I had to aſſert, that the Catholick Church was in order of Nature antecedent to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches; for a Church, which is one by Inſtitution, muſt begin in one, and enlarge it ſelf by receiving others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Unity of the ſame Body, which for the convenience of Worſhip and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, may form themſelves into diſtinct, but not ſeparate Church-Societies.</p>
               <p>This is an intelligible Account, how all the Churches in the World come to be but one Church, as proceeding from one principle of Unity, from one Root and Stock, and by the neceſſary Laws of their Conſtitution incorporated into one Body, and cloſely united to each others; but thoſe who make particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to be entire and compleat Churches by themſelves, in order of Nature and time too, antecedent to the Catholick Church, muſt either make the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church an imaginary Being, a meer <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> does, or elſe no better then an arbitrary Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may laſt as long as they pleaſe,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93053:23"/>and be diſſolved again, when they pleaſe, and yet the particular Churches remain very entire and perfect Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es without it. It is certain, that the Catholick Church cannot be one Church and one Body, if any particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by their eſſential Conſtitution are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire compleat Churches, and not integral parts of the Catholick Church, which they cannot be without ſuch a neceſſary Union as I have now deſcribed.</p>
               <p>And to conclude this Argument, I ſhall refer Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> for better Inſtruction in this Matter to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who, in Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>Whether a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Church, or the Catholick Church be firſt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> p. 202.</note> Reſolves it thus. <hi>Chriſt was firſt himſelf, and then, Chriſtians as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited to him, and were the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church in</hi> Fieri, <hi>or an</hi> Embrio: <hi>And then the Paſtor's Office, was made as the Organical Office to make the reſt, —And when the particular Churches are formed, they are thereby parts of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and as ſuch are,</hi> Simul et Semel, <hi>ſuch Churches and ſuch parts.</hi> Now though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and I are not like to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree very well in our Notions of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, (a particular Account of which I ſhall give hereafter) yet here
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93053:23"/>are ſeveral things for the Inſtruction of Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> and to vindicate my Notion from ſuch ridiculous Abſurdity, as he charges it with. For, 1. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges an univerſal Church, <hi>In fieri or Embrio,</hi> before any particular organized Church, before the Apoſtolical Office it ſelf, which is more than I ſay, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make the firſt Church, <hi>The Root and Fountain of Catholick unity.</hi> 2. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, That <hi>when particular Churches are founded, they are thereby parts of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church;</hi> and therefore the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church muſt be in order of Nature before particular Churches, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiſtent with their being, <hi>Simul &amp; ſemel,</hi> in order of time. And that he does not look upon the univerſal Church, to be a meer, <hi>Ens Rationis, in an</hi> Euto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> but a real exiſtent thing appears from hence, that in the next Paragraph, he owns, <hi>Particular Churches to be integral parts of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Concerning Catholick Communion.</head>
               <p>HAving thus vindicated my Notion of Catholick unity, the next thing in order (for I ſhall confine my ſelf to the Method I obſerved in the Defence, that my Readers may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know, what the preſent Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is, which my Adverſaries have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to conceal, as well as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent) concerns Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>I aſſerted and proved at large,<note place="margin">Defence, p. 169.</note> Ch. 4. <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Catholick Church, conſiſts in one Communion.</hi> I explained what this one Communion is, produced variety of Proofs for it, from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture, and Ancient Fathers; and none of my Adverſaries yet have had the confidence to attempt any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, either by ſhewing that my Arguments are not cogent, my Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities from Scripture, or Fathers imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent or falſe: Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> thinks it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſtart ſome difficult Caſes, and to confront me with the Authority of ſome
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93053:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>late Writers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who, as he, who underſtands neither one nor th'other, imagines, contradict what I ſay; which, if it were ſo indeed, is neither a ſufficient Anſwer to me, who prefer the Authority of the Scripture, and Ancient Fathers, before any Modern Doctors, of what Note ſoever; nor a ſufficient juſtification of himſelf and his party, who are condemned by theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men, whoſe Authority they oppoſe againſt me, though they do not value it themſelves.</p>
               <p>An Argument, <hi>Ad hominem,</hi> can never eſtabliſh a Cauſe, though in ſome caſes it may ſilence an Adverſary; and it is an evident ſign of great prevarication, when men fence only with ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, as they themſelves do not think valid, as it is a deſperate Cauſe, when they can neither confute the Reaſons which are alledged, nor oppoſe Reaſon to Reaſon; but Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> ſhall have a fair hearing preſently.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſeems not to have read this Chapter, which is the main ſeat of the Controverſie, but skips to the 8th. Chapter, where this Doctrine of one Communion is applyed to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and this is the Reaſon, why
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93053:25"/>he does not underſtand, what I mean by one Communion, but imagines, that I have a Grammar or Dictionary by my ſelf, and will excommunicate them, and make them Schiſmaticks, for ſpeaking as all mankind do. Good man, he is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle miſtaken in this Matter, as uſually he is, and as every man muſt be, who confutes Books before he reads or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands them, and replies before he knows what to anſwer.</p>
               <p>However,<note place="margin">Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> c. 6. p. 208.</note> let us hear what terrible Objections he has againſt this plain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that the Unity of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church conſiſts in one Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I ſhall tranſcribe his Reaſons, and then give a plain and eaſie Anſwer to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſays, <hi>This is contrary to the common courſe of Nature, in which the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of all compounded beings maketh them what they are, and goeth before their Operations and Effects. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Soul and Body goeth before Senſation, Imagination, Intellection, or Volition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is contrary to all Artificial beings in a Clock, a Watch, a Coach,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of their parts is their relative Form, and goeth before the Exerciſe, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and the Effects.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93053:25"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is contrary to all Political Beings and Societies: The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of King and Subjects is the conſtitutive Form of the Kingdom, and goeth before the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration or Regiment, by Legiſlation and Judgement, and the Allegiance and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction before Obedience. Thus the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Husband and Wife, Master and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Captain and Souldiers, Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Scholars, as the Conſtitution of the Relation, go before their Communion in the Exerciſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>If <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion be all one, then a man is new made a Christian at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Act of Communion; for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is the Conſtitution, and makes us Christians; but the Conſequence is not true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion be all one, then Baptiſm doth no more make us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and unite us to Chriſt and his Church, than after-Communion in Prayer and Sacraments do; but this is ſingular and falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What pity is it, that ſo many good Arguments ſhould be loſt, for want of ſome Thing and ſome Body to oppoſe? for all theſe Arguments proceed upon this Miſtake, That by <hi>Communion,</hi> I mean only ſome tranſient Acts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion, ſuch as Praying, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93053:26"/>Hearing, and Receiving the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per together; that the Chriſtian Church is united by ſuch Acts as theſe; whereas theſe Acts of Chriſtian Communion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuppoſe Chriſtian Union, and therefore can neither be the efficient nor formal Cauſe of it: A man muſt firſt be united to the Church, and one Church to another, before they can communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate together in ſuch Acts of Worſhip, or have any Right to do ſo.</p>
               <p>But then I wonder, what he thought I meant by <hi>one Communion;</hi> for if by <hi>Communion,</hi> I meant only a tranſient Act of Communion, by <hi>one Communion,</hi> I could mean but one ſuch tranſient Act. And here he might have found out greater Abſurdities than before, and have triumphed over this ſenſleſs Notion unmercifully; for what a ridiculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is it, to place Chriſtian Unity in ſome one tranſient Act? But poſſibly Mr. <hi>B.</hi> might ſee this Abſurdity, and be merciful to it, for the ſake of his darling Notion of Occaſional Communion, which is juſt ſuch a tranſient Act, and yet, as he thinks, ſufficient to Church Unity, and to juſtifie any man from the Guilt of Schiſm and Separation. But then I cannot but wonder, that he ſhould
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93053:26"/>ſo induſtriouſly prove, that the Unity of the Church cannot conſiſt in ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Acts of Communion; for if this be true, (as certainly it is) he may be a Schiſmatick from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> notwithſtanding he ſometimes holds <hi>Occaſional Communion</hi> with her.</p>
               <p>But had Mr. <hi>B.</hi> carefully read and conſidered but the ſix firſt Lines of the <hi>4th.</hi> Chap. of the <hi>Defence,</hi> where I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, what I mean by <hi>one Communion,</hi> he might have ſpared all his Arguments, from natural, artificial, and political Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. My words are theſe;<note place="margin">Defence p. 164.</note> 
                  <hi>The 2d. thing to be conſidered is, That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Christian Church conſists in one Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Catholick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity ſignifies Catholick Communion, and one Communion ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies one Christian Society, of which all Christians are Members.</hi> From which it is plain, That I did not place this one Communion in any tranſient Acts, but in a fixed and permanent State. And that this is not a new, uncouth way of ſpeaking, but very agreeable to the Language of Scripture and Antiquity, I made appear in the ſame place, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>This is ſufficient to let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what the Ancients meant by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Communion, which in a large notion,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93053:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſignifies the Christian Church or Society, which is called Communion, from the Communication which all the Members of it had with each other.</hi> So that when I ſay, the Unity of the Catholick Church conſiſts in one Communion, the plain and obvious ſenſe of it is this, That all the Churches of the World are but one Church or one Society, and have the ſame Right, and the ſame Obligation on them, to communicate with each other, as opportunity ſerves, in all thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for the ſake of which Chriſtian Churches are inſtituted, as the Members of a particular Church are. For all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches are as much Members of the univerſal Church, as particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are Members of a particular Church, and therefore are as much bound to communicate with each other: One Communion ſignifies one Body and Society, in which all the Members com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with one another. As to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this by a familiar Compariſon: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the whole World were one Family, or one Kingdom, in which every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, according to his Rank and Station, enjoys equal Priviledges; in this caſe the neceſſity of Affairs would require, that men ſhould live in diſtinct
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93053:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>Houſes, and diſtinct Countreys, as now they do all the World over: But yet if every man enjoyed the ſame Liberty and Priviledges, where-ever he went, as he does now in his own Houſe and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the whole World would be but one great Family, or univerſal Kingdom. And whoſoever ſhould reſolve to live by himſelf, and not to receive any others into his Family, nor allow them the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his Houſe, would be guilty of making a Schiſm in this great Family of the World; and what Nation ſoever ſhould deny the Rights and Priviledges of natural Subjects, to the Inhabitants of other Countreys, would make a Schiſm, and rent it ſelf from this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Thus it is here: The Church of Chriſt is but one Body, one Church, one Houſhold and Family, one Kingdom; and therefore though the neceſſity of Affairs requires, that neighbour-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans combine themſelves into particular Churches and particular Congregations, as the World is divided into particular Families and Kingdoms, yet every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian by vertue of his Chriſtianity, hath the ſame Right and Priviledge, and the ſame Obligation to Communion, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93053:28"/>ſerves, with all the Churches of the World, that he has with that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church wherein he lives: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he removes his Dwelling, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Church he goes to, he is ſtill in the ſame Family, the ſame Kingdom, and the ſame Church.</p>
               <p>I can hardly be ſo charitable to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as not to believe this to be a wilful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; for it is impoſſible for any man of common ſenſe, who had ever read what I diſcourſed ſo largely and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of Catholick Communion, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake it for ſome tranſient Acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, when I ſo frequently explained one Communion by one Body and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: And all the Arguments whereby I prove one Catholick Communion, prove only that all Chriſtians and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches are but one Body, and thereby obliged to all Duties and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Acts of Chriſtian Communion, which are conſequent upon ſuch a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this is a ſufficient Anſwer to his three firſt Arguments, from natural, artificial, and political Unions.</p>
               <p>But upon a ſtricter Examination of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Arguments, I find he is as much blundered and confounded about the notion of Unity, as he is about Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93053:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>I aſſerted, that Catholick Unity conſiſts in one Communion; the plain ſenſe of which is no more than this, That the Catholick Church is one, conſidered as one Body and Society, wherein all Chriſtians and Chriſtian Churches have equal Right and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſtian Communion. This Unity he turns into Union, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it of our Union to Chriſt, not of the Unity or Oneneſs of the Chriſtian Church, and argues thus: 4. <hi>If <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion be all one, then a man is new made a Chriſtian at every Act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is the Constitution, and makes us Christians.</hi> 5. <hi>If <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion be all one, then Baptiſm doth no more make us Chriſtians, and unite us to Chriſt and his Church, than after-Communion in Prayers and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do.</hi> Where you ſee he miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrues both the terms; and it would be wonderful to any Logician, to hear him conclude from theſe premiſſes, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Unity of the Catholick Church does not conſiſt in its being one Body and Society, and Communion of Chriſtians. If this be to write Controverſies, we may e'ne as well lay Wagers, and caſt Lots for <hi>Major, Minor,</hi> and <hi>Concluſion;</hi> for any
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93053:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>Propoſitions well ſhuffled, will naturally fall into as good Syllogiſms as theſe.</p>
               <p>And yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had notice given him of this diſtinction between the Union of the Church to Chriſt, and the Unity of all Churches in one Body and Society, in the <hi>8th..</hi> Chap. of the <hi>Defence,</hi> where I conſider, <hi>what Communion is eſſential to the Catholick or univerſal Church;</hi> where the Reader may find theſe words, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himſelf takes notice of: <hi>I have already proved the Catholick Church to be one viſible Body and Society,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</hi> p. 208</note> 
                  <hi>and therefore need not now add any thing more to confute that opinion, that the Catholick Church is inviſible, which is aſſerted by Dr.</hi> Owen, <hi>and his</hi> Independent <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. But Mr.</hi> B. <hi>and others, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge one viſible Catholick Church, conſiſting of all the particular Churches in the World, do not much differ from Dr.</hi> O<hi>'s. inviſible Church, while they make the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of this Church to conſiſt only in their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to Christ, as Head of the Church, not in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Churches, as Members of the ſame Body: For I take it not to be enough, that all Churches are united to Chriſt, unleſs they be all united in one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for the whole Church cannot be the one Body of Chriſt, unleſs all particular
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93053:29"/>Churches are one Body. And therefore I would deſire Mr.</hi> B. <hi>and his Brethren to tell us, how the whole Catholick Church is united into one Body: I aſſert, this is done by one Communion; if he can tell any better way, I would gladly learn it, eſpecially if he can tell me, how all Churches can be one Body without one Communion.</hi> This <hi>ſudden Humiliation,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls it, in being contented <hi>to learn of him,</hi> makes him condeſcend to undertake this task to teach me, but very much ſuſpects my capacity to learn, till I am better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by ſome <hi>Grammarians, Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and Political Teachers, what the meaning of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion is,</hi>

                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 209.</note> 
                  <hi>what is the difference between Eſſentials, and Integrals, and Accidents, and of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Communion in each of theſe, and how many ſorts of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion there are, that are pertinent to our Caſe,</hi> &amp;c. I do not wonder, there are ſo few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who underſtand Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of learning from him, ſince there are ſo many things to be underſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, to prepare them for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as no man of ſenſe can ever underſtand.</p>
               <p>I ask Mr. <hi>B.</hi> one plain Queſtion, How the whole Catholick Church is united in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93053:30"/>one Body, ſo as to become one Church? In Anſwer to this, he ſends me to <hi>Grammarians</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſicians,</hi> to learn how many ſorts of Union there are; though I care not how many ſorts of Union there are, if he will tell me, what the Unity of the Catholick Church is. But he ſays, 1. <hi>He cannot talk ſenſe about theſe things, without distinguiſhing about the unifying of the Society, and the uniting a ſingle Member to that Society.</hi> But I ſuppoſe in my Queſtion, particular Churches already formed, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians united to theſe Churches, and only enquire, how all theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and all theſe Churches are one Church. Other men, I believe, could talk ſenſe, without theſe Diſtinctions, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſeems to be ſo fond of, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prevent his Readers from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſenſe. 2. <hi>He muſt diſtinguiſh alſo an eſſentiating <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grating or accidental <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> I perceive we ſhall never come to the Buſineſs: For I did not enquire, wherein the eſſence of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, or what degrees of Communion are more or leſs neceſſary to its Being, which I ſuppoſe he means by his eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, integrating, accidental Union and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93053:30"/>Communion; but I ſuppoſe a thouſand Churches, or as many more as you pleaſe, with all the Eſſentials, Integrals, Accidentals of a Church, and enquire how theſe thouſand Churches become one Church. Poſſibly theſe Diſtinctions may be the way of ſpeaking ſenſe, but I perceive they are not the way of ſpeaking to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But let us now conſider the Account Mr. <hi>B.</hi> gives us of this Matter: And 1. he ſays, <hi>It is only eſſential to the Church, that there be an organized Body of Paſtors and People united to Chriſt the Head.</hi> Here I agree with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> if he would add <hi>one Body;</hi> for that is the thing in Diſpute, whether Chriſt have one or a thouſand Bodies; if but one, how all the Chriſtians and Churches in the World make up that one Body. 2. He adds, <hi>In this Definition, Chriſt only is the ſupream, conſtitutive,</hi> Summa Poteſtas, <hi>or regent part; the organized Body of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and People, but the</hi> Pars ſubdita, <hi>and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Chriſt and that Body maketh it a Church.</hi> This is very well ſtill: We acknowledge Chriſt to be the ſupream Governour of his Church, and that the Union of Paſtors and People to Chriſt makes them a Church; but the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93053:31"/>main Queſtion ſtill remains untouched, What it is, which makes all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Paſtors and People in the World to be but <hi>one Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor does his Similitude help him out, which is ſo admirable in its Philoſophy and Application, that I cannot let it paſs. His words are theſe: <hi>As in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man,</hi> 1. <hi>The rational Soul is the real Form, which is,</hi> Principium Motus. 2. <hi>The organized Body is the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Matter: That there be Heart, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Stomach, is but the Bodies Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation; that theſe parts be duly placed and united, is</hi> Forma Corporis, non Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, <hi>and makes the Body but</hi> Materia diſpoſita. 3. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is that</hi> Nexus, (<hi>like the</hi> Copula <hi>in a Propoſition</hi>) <hi>which may be called the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Form, or that which maketh the Soul become</hi> Forma in actu. Had this Philoſophy been known in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s days, I ſhould not much have wondred, that he warns men againſt vain Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. I ſhall avoid diſputing with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as much as I can, and therefore ſhall not quarrel with him for ſaving, that the Soul is <hi>Principium Motus,</hi> the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or firſt Cauſe and Principle of Motion to the Body, though it may be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93053:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſome <hi>Carteſians</hi> will not like it: Nor for affirming, that the Union of Soul and Body, is but like the <hi>Copula</hi> in a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which is a ſpeck and ſpang new Notion; but ſhall only conſider, how he applies this to the Church. Chriſt it ſeems then is the Soul, and Chriſtians the Body; though in Scripture he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as the Head of the Body, and the divine Spirit as the Soul which enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and animates it: And if Chriſt be not the Head of the Body, (which I think the Soul was never accounted yet) the Church muſt be without a Head, or have ſome other Head than Chriſt, which I ſuppoſe is the Reaſon, why he talks ſo much of a conſtitutive Regent Head of the Church. But <hi>the organized Body is the constitutive Matter</hi> of the man, though other Philoſophers uſed to call the Body a conſtitutive part; but to let that paſs. Thus an organical Church is <hi>the conſtitutive Matter;</hi> of what? Of Chriſt, or of his Church, or of ſome third thing compounded of both? <hi>That there be Heart, Liver, Stomach, is but the Bodies Organization;</hi> this is eaſily appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus Apoſtles, Prophets, Paſtors and Teachers, and People, make an organical Church; but <hi>that theſe parts
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93053:32"/>be duly placed and united, is</hi> Forma Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris, non Hominis, is the Form of the Body, not of the Man; which what it means, I cannot tell, unleſs that a man would be a man, though the ſeveral parts of his Body did not ſtand in their right places, nor were united to one another; ſo they were all united to the Soul. And thus the Catholick Church is one Body, by being united to Chriſt, though the parts of it are not united to each other; and much ſuch a Body it is, as the natural Body would be, did the Legs and Arms grow out of the Head, and every Member change places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any order, or divide from each other, and hang together only by a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical kind of Union with the Soul. Well, but this Organization and due Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Parts, makes the Body, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria diſpoſita,</hi> Matter fitly diſpoſed; I ſuppoſe he means, for Union with the Soul: But is this diſpoſition of the Matter ſo neceſſary, that a Soul cannot unite with a Body otherwiſe diſpoſed, without forfeiting the external Form of a Man, his Senſes, or his Underſtanding? And conſequently, that no reaſonable Soul, which is not under ſome force, would unite with ſuch a Body. If this be his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93053:32"/>meaning, it ſits our preſent Caſe very well; for then the Church cannot be united to Chriſt in one Body, without union with it ſelf; and the Unity of the Catholick Church cannot conſiſt meerly in the union of all particular Churches in and to Chriſt, without any union among themſelves. But how to apply the <hi>Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> in a Propoſition, either to the union of Soul or Body, or of Chriſt and his Church, I cannot tell, and ſhall never be able to learn, till I meet with ſome new <hi>Baxterian</hi> Logick, as well as Grammar and Metaphyſicks. But to proceed, as a farther Explication of this Matter, he adds,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion there is no</hi> Summa Poteſtas, <hi>or univerſal Governour, (Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical or Ariſtocratical) but Chriſt.</hi> In this we agree alſo, as will appear more hereafter.</p>
               <p>And now or never to the Point: 4. <hi>The Body is ſufficiently organized, if it conſists of local Churches, called ſingle or particular, being Paſtors and Chriſtian People, (having all the Eſſentials of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.)</hi> But is our Diſpute then about the Organization, or about the Unity of the Body? The Catholick Church has no other Organization, but that of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93053:33"/>particular Churches; but there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more required to make it one: No, ſays Mr. <hi>B. that which maketh this Body</hi> (that is, all the Chriſtians and Chriſtian Churches in the World) <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Church,</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>one Church</hi>) <hi>is no union of the Members among themſelves:</hi> So that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church may be one Body, without the union of its Members among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> it may be one without Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But why ſhould not union of the Members among themſelves be neceſſary to make a Church one? Becauſe, ſays Mr. <hi>B. that maketh them only</hi> Materia diſpoſita, <hi>i. e.</hi> Matter diſpoſed, prepared, fitted; but for what? To be one Church? I ſhould rather think, that the union of ſeveral Churches makes them one Church, and does not only prepare and diſpoſe them to be one, unleſs he can tell, how they can be more one than by Unity. But however, are any other Churches, which have no union among themſelves, this <hi>Materia diſpoſita,</hi> or Matter diſpoſed and fitted to make one Catholick Church? If they be, then there is no need of any Union, ſo much as to diſpoſe and prepare the Matter: If they be not, then I ſtill enquire, what
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93053:33"/>that Union of Churches is, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make them fit matter for the Catholick Church? But this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has not yet vouchſafed to tell me; though poſſibly this may be one of thoſe things, which I muſt learn from ſome Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians or Metaphyſicians, before I can be capable of his Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us, how the Church is one without any Union of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers among themſelves, <hi>viz. by their common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Christ, and then all ſingle Perſons and Churches are one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, becauſe united in and to him, as all Lines are united in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> So that there is no neceſſity of any other Union between ſeveral Churches to make them one Catholick Church, but that they are all united to Chriſt the common Center; they are one Church, though as diſtant and oppoſite to each other, as the two Poles, becauſe they meet in the ſame Center.</p>
               <p>But 1. This is a pretty eaſie way of determining Controverſies to out-face all the Authority of Scripture and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, by a dogmatical Aſſertion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering the leaſt Reaſon or ſhadow of Reaſon to confirm it: I had at large proved the neceſſity of one Catholick
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93053:34"/>Communion to make one Catholick Church, and inſtead of anſwering theſe Proofs, he aſſerts the contrary upon his own naked Authority, and that muſt paſs for a Confutation.</p>
               <p>And 2. He takes that for granted, which I can never grant him, that thoſe Churches which are divided from each other, by ſeparate and oppoſite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, may yet be all united to Chriſt; for Chriſt has but one Body, one Spouſe, one Flock, one Church, and if we be not Members of this one Church, (as no Schiſmaticks are) we are not united to Chriſt: and therefore it is a vain thing to talk of uniting thoſe in Chriſt, who are not united among themſelves; for Chriſt hath not an hundred ſeveral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but one Body, and we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Unity of this Body, if we will enjoy Union and Communion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When he places the Unity of the Catholick Church, in the Union of all ſingle Perſons and Churches in and to Chriſt, he muſt either mean this of an external and viſible Union to Chriſt, by an external and viſible profeſſion of Faith in him, or a real, internal, myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:93053:34"/>
               <p n="1">1. If he mean the Firſt, an external and viſible Union to Chriſt, I obſerve, that this can neither be made, nor be known, but by ſomething, which is external and viſible. We cannot know, that any Society of men is the Church of Chriſt, but by their external profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith in him, and ſubjection to him; nor can we know, that a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Societies are the ſame Church, but by ſome common Profeſſion and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; and if, by the Inſtitution of our Saviour, one Communion be eſſential to the Notion of one Church, as I have abundantly proved it is, then the viſible Union of all Churches, in and to Chriſt, conſiſts in their viſible Communion with each other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he mean a myſtical internal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I have two things to ſay to him. 1. This makes the Catholick Church inviſible; for if the Unity of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church conſiſts only in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Churches in Chriſt, and this Union be a myſtical inviſible Union, then the Catholick Church it ſelf muſt be inviſible too. 2. Though particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians may be thus myſtically united to Chriſt, yet no particular Churches are thus united to Chriſt much
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93053:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>leſs all the particular Churches in the World, unleſs you will ſay, that none belong to the Church, but thoſe Perſons who are true and ſincere Chriſtians, which reduces the Church to the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of the Elect, and deſtroyes not only the Viſibility, but in many caſes the Organization of the Church on Earth, for I fear the Paſtors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the viſible Church, are not alwayes inviſibly united to Chriſt, and therefore according to this way of arguing, it is not viſible, whether Chriſt have an organical Church on Earth: which ſhows how abſurd it is, to place the Unity of the Catholick Church, in this inviſible Union of particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I may add 3. That no men are thus viſibly united to Chriſt, who are not viſible Members of the Catholick Church, and do not live in viſible Communion with it, when it may be had; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we deſtroy the neceſſity of a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, or of a viſible Profeſſion, and Practiſe of Chriſtian Communion, even in particular Churches: Which ſhows, that the Notion of Catholick Unity, and a Catholick Church, does not conſiſt in ſuch an inviſible Union
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93053:35"/>to Chriſt, for our inviſible Union to Chriſt, neceſſarily ſuppoſes our viſible Communion with his Church; and ſince Chriſt hath but one Church, it requires our viſible Communion with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; and this ſuppoſes that there is a viſible Catholick Church, of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Conſideration from the inviſible Church of the Elect, which therefore cannot be founded on an inviſible Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt, but on ſomething which is viſible, ſuch an external Profeſſion, and external Communion, as may be ſeen. The ſum is this, No Church can be the Church of Chriſt, but upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome Union to him, either vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or inviſible, or both; but that which makes all the Churches of the World, the one Church and Body of Chriſt, muſt be an Union amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which I have proved, conſiſts in one Catholick Communion. What Mr. <hi>B.</hi> farther adds, proceeding upon the ſame Miſtake, needs no particular Anſwer; and what deſerves any farther Examination, will fall in under another Head.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> (I confeſs) has pinched harder in this Cauſe, having alleadged ſome venerable Names in the Church of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93053:36"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> againſt me, Arch-biſhop <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> all very great men, to whoſe Memories I cannot but pay a juſt Reverence and Reſpect: But yet if it ſhould appear, that my Notion of Catholick Communion ſhould differ from theirs (as I think it does in ſome Points from Arch-biſhop <hi>Bramhal's</hi>) while I have the Authority of Scripture, and the primitive Church, I think my ſelf very ſafe, notwithſtanding the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of any modern Doctors, of what note ſoever. Only hence we may learn, with what Judgment and Honeſty Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> charges me with carrying on the <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> Deſign, when I differ from the Arch-biſhop in thoſe very Points, for which he was (though very unjuſtly) charged with it.</p>
               <p>But let us examine Particulars. I aſſert, that all Chriſtians and Chriſtian Churches in the World are one Body, Society, or Church; and this is called Catholick Communion, becauſe it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them all to communicate in all the external Offices and Duties of Religion and Church-Society, and Memberſhip, as occaſion offers, eſpecially neighbour-Chriſtians are bound to live together in external Communion with that Church
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93053:36"/>in which they are; and that whoever cauſeleſly ſeparates from any Church, which lives in Catholick Communion, is a Schiſmatick from the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> to avoid this,<note place="margin">Reply to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, p. 14</note> alledges the Authority of Arch-biſhop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> and triumphs over me after his uſual rate, for not having con'd my Leſſon well, nor ſufficiently digeſted my Notions, which he ſuppoſes I learnt (though very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly) from this great Maſter: he tells me, <hi>This great Prelate uſes ſeveral diſtinctions about Communion, which would have been for my purpoſe and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:</hi> Though whoever reads my Book, will find, that I was not ignorant of theſe Diſtinctions, but did not think them to my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop ſayes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bramhal</hi>'s Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Tom. 2. Diſc. 2. P. 57.</note> 
                  <hi>The Communion of the Chriſtian Catholick Church, is partly internal, partly external:</hi> And do I any where deny this? The Queſtion only is, whether internal Communion will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe men from the guilt of Schiſm, who ſeparate from the external Communion of the Church, when it may be had without ſin? And this I deny, and do not ſee, where the Biſhop aſſerts the contrary.</p>

               <p>But let us hear, what <hi>internal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> is, which he ſayes, <hi>conſists prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in theſe things. To believe the ſame entire ſubſtance of ſaving neceſſary Truth revealed by the Apoſtles, and to be ready implicitely in the Preparation of the mind, to imbrace all other ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Verities, when they ſhall be ſufficiently propoſed to them: to judge charitably of one another.</hi> And do not I alſo expreſly ſay,<note place="margin">Defence, p. 171.</note> that <hi>the ſame Faith, and mutual Love and Charity, are the Bonds and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments of Chriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion?</hi>

                  <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Faith must be acknowledged, as abſolutely neceſſary to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, for Hereticks are no Members of the Christian Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we muſt <hi>exclude none from the Catholick Communion and hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either Eaſtern, or Weſtern, or Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, or Northern Chriſtians, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the ancient Faith of the Apoſtles and primitive Fathers, eſtabliſhed in the firſt general Councils, and comprehended in the Apoſtolick,</hi> Nicene <hi>and</hi> Athanaſian <hi>Creeds:</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> makes a Query, <hi>Whether, ſeeing the Faith contained in theſe Creeds, is profeſſed by the Diſſenters, this Gentleman doth not fall ſhort in this reſpect of Catholick internal Communion,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93053:37"/>by excluding the Diſſenters from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, and hope of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But our Queſtioniſt ſhould have conſidered, that to <hi>exclude from Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion,</hi> is an ambiguous Phraſe, and may ſignifie two very different things. 1. Not to receive thoſe into our Communion, who are willing and deſirous to communicate with us; and thus no man, that I know of, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, exclude Diſſenters from Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion, and thereby, from the ordinary means of Salvation, which is to be had only in the Unity of the Church. Or 2. It may ſignifie not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe for the Members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, who divide themſelves from the external and viſible Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it, while they profeſs the ſame Catholick Faith. If the Biſhop meant this, by excluding from Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, all that I ſhall ſay to it, is this, that he muſt condemn St. <hi>Cyprian, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> and all the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Biſhops in their dayes, and St. <hi>Austin, Optatus,</hi> and the Catholick Church in their time, for excluding the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> from Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the hope of Salvation, not for any Error or Hereſie in Faith, but for a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93053:38"/>Schiſmatical Separation from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; and I am contented to be a Schiſmatick in ſo good Company, as the Catholick Church in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s dayes. But I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at large in the Defence,<note place="margin">P. 171, &amp;c.</note> that the ſame Faith is not ſufficient to make any men Catholick Chriſtians, who ſeparate from the external Communion of the Catholick Church; but this our Author did not think fit to meddle with.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> proceeds, <hi>Moreover as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Communion,</hi> ſayes <hi>Bramhal, there are degrees of Excluſion,</hi> and did I ever deny this? Do I make all the Cenſures of the Church equal? <hi>But it may be waved or withdrawn by particular Churches or Perſons, from their neighbour Churches and Christians in their Innovations and Errors,</hi> moſt certain! If they be ſuch Innovations and Errors, as make their Communion ſinful; but every Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor every Error, which does not corrupt their Religious Worſhip, is no juſt cauſe for a Separation, or for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or withdrawing Communion. But of this more hereafter.</p>
               <p>He adds from Biſhop <hi>Bramhal, Nor is there ſo strict and perpetual adherence required to a particular Church, as there
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93053:38"/>is to the univerſal Church:</hi> But how I am concern'd in this, I cannot ſee; for by <hi>adherence to the univerſal Church,</hi> the Biſhop ſeems to mean, adhering to the Judgment or Decrees of the univerſal Church aſſembled in a general Council, which he makes the ſupream Authority of the Church on Earth, and therefore prefers their Decrees before the Decrees or Canons of any particular Church; and I agree with him ſo far, that the Judgment of a general Council, if ſuch a Council could be had, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Decrees of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, and ought not, without ſome neceſſary and apparent Reaſons, be ſlighted or diſobeyed by particular Chriſtians or Churches; though I do not make a general Council, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive regent Head of the Catholick Church; but if by <hi>adherence</hi> Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> will underſtand <hi>Communion,</hi> I do aſſert, that Communion with a particular Church, which is it ſelf in Catholick Communion, is as neceſſary as Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Catholick Church, and he that ſeparates from any ſuch Church, ſeparates and divides himſelf from the Catholick Church; and this I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, till I ſee better Reaſon for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:93053:39"/>
               <p>Let us now conſider how he urges me with the Authority of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Dr. <hi>Field.</hi> I aſſert that the Unity of the Catholick Church conſiſts in one Communion, and conſequently that thoſe Chriſtians and Churches which do not live in Catholick Communion, are no Members of the Catholick Church, but are out of the Church, <hi>extra Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam foris,</hi> according to the Language of the primitive Fathers. Whereas I acknowledge, he has proved by very plain Teſtimonies from Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> that they own all thoſe for Chriſtians and Members of the viſible Church, who profeſs the Faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and are baptized, though they be Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, Idolaters, excommunicable or excommunicated Perſons; and therefore either Chriſt muſt have more Churches than one, which I deny, or the Unity of the Catholick Church cannot conſiſt in one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as I aſſert; for Schiſmaticks, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Idolaters, are not in the ſame Communion, and yet are all Members of the viſible Church. I own his Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> and therefore need not repeat them, and have repreſented the Objection with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93053:39"/>greater Advantage and Perſpicuity, than he has himſelf; for I neither deſign to cheat my ſelf, nor to impoſe upon my Readers, nor to perpetuate Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, as my Adverſaries do, by falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of Things, or ſome ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and ſophiſtical Arts to put by a Blow.</p>
               <p>But all this appearing Difference is not real but verbal: Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Dr. <hi>Field</hi> believe Schiſmaticks and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks to be as much out of the Church, as I do; and I believe them to be as much in the Church, as they do.</p>
               <p>When Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> aſſerts, That all that profeſs the Faith of Chriſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, whether Schiſmaticks, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Idolaters, are Members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of Chriſt, he underſtands the viſible Church in a large Notion, to comprehend the whole Body of profeſs'd Chriſtians. And therefore the Reaſon he aſſigns for it is, becauſe all Mankind are Chriſtians or Infidels: Thoſe who believe in Chriſt, what-ever their other Errors in Doctrine, or Miſcarriages in Life and Practice may be, are Chriſtians in ſome ſenſe notwithſtanding, and therefore viſible Members of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, as that comprehends all
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93053:40"/>Chriſtians; but thoſe who do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, are Infidels. Now I acknowledge, as much as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> can do, that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a profeſt Chriſtian, though a Schiſmatick, Heretick, Idolater, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and an Infidel. Such Perſons, who have been once incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the Church by Baptiſm, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they prove after, may be reſtored to the Church again, without being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized; but an Infidel cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without Baptiſm, which is a plain proof, that the firſt do in ſome ſenſe belong to the Body of Chriſt, and that the other do not. Baptized Chriſtians, though Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhall at the laſt day be judged not as Infidels, but as wicked and apoſtate Chriſtians; when men are made the Members of Chriſt's Body by Baptiſm, and an external profeſſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, they can never alter this Character, but ſhall be finally judged, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or rewarded as Chriſtians, and upon this account may ſtill be ſaid to belong to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> whoſe Authority Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> alledges againſt me, has plainly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled this appearing difference, as every
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93053:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>ordinary Reader would have ſeen, had our Author been ſo honeſt, as to have tranſcribed the whole Paragraph; and therefore ſince he has only cited a part of it,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> of the Church, 1. B. Ch. 13</note> I will tranſcribe the whole: His words are theſe: <hi>This is the firſt ſort of them, that depart and go out from the Church of God, and Company of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> (<hi>viz,</hi> Schiſmaticks) <hi>whoſe departure yet is not ſuch, but that notwithſtanding their Schiſm, they are and remain parts of the Church of God; for whereas in the Church of God, is found an entire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the ſaving Truth of God, Order of holy Miniſtry, Sacraments by vertue thereof adminiſtred, and a bleſſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Fellowſhip of the People of God, knit together in the bond of Peace, under the command of lawful Pastors and Guides, ſet over them to direct them in the wayes of eternal Happineſs: Schiſmaticks not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Separation, remain still conjoyned with the rest of God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in reſpect of the Profeſſion of the whole ſaving Truth of God, all outward acts of Religion and Divine Worſhip, power of Order and holy Sacraments, which they by vertue thereof administer, and ſo ſtill are and remain parts of the Church of God: But as their Communion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93053:41"/>and Conjunction with the reſt of God's People, is in ſome things only and not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in all, wherein they have and ought to have Fellowſhip, ſo are they not fully and abſolutely of the Church, nor of that more ſpecial number of them, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate intirely and abſolutely in all things neceſſary, in which ſenſe they are rightly denied to be of the Church; which I take to be their meaning, that ſay they are not of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that Dr. <hi>Field</hi> expreſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that Schiſmaticks may be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied to be of the Church, though they continuing Chriſtians by external profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, may in a looſe and large ſenſe of the Word, be ſaid to belong to the Chriſtian Church, as they retain ſomething which belongs to the Church ſtill among them.</p>
               <p>But to make this more plain and eaſie, I ſhall briefly diſtinguiſh between the ſeveral Notions and Acceptations of a Church. For 1. the Church ſometimes ſignifies the number of the Elect, that is, all ſincere Chriſtians, who are vitally united to Chriſt by a true and lively Faith, a divine Love and Charity, and all other Chriſtian Graces and Vertues, who are living and fruitful Branches in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93053:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>this ſpiritual Vine. And this Church is commonly called the myſtical Body of Chriſt, by reaſon of that myſterious uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is between Chriſt and good men, and the inviſible Church, becauſe we, who cannot know the Hearts of men, cannot certainly know who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to this Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the viſible Catholick Church, which conſiſts of all thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Churches, who profeſs the true Faith of Chriſt, obſerve his Laws and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and live in Communion and Fellowſhip with each other. This Church is called viſible, from its viſible profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, and external and viſible Communion; and Catholick, becauſe all ſuch Churches all the World over, are but one Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is that Church which is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Body and Spouſe of Chriſt, to the Communion of which, all the ordinary means of Salvation are annexed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. Now it is commonly and truly obſerved, that there are ſome profeſſed Chriſtians, who are only in this Church, others who are of it, and others who are out of it. Thoſe who are in the Church, but not true Members of it, are thoſe profeſſed Chriſtians, who live in the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93053:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>Communion of the Church, but yet are either ſecret Hypocrites, or openly wicked, but not excommunicated; theſe are in the Church by external Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as dead and withered Branches are in the Vine, till they be cut off. All ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere good Chriſtians are both in the Church and of it; they are in the Church by an external and viſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and an external Communion, which is abſolutely required of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, when it may be had; and they are of the Church, that is, true and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Members of it, by a ſincere Faith and Obedience to Chriſt. None properly belong to the viſible Church, but thoſe whom we call the inviſible Church, that is, all ſincere Chriſtians; for the viſible and inviſible are not two, but one Church. And the Reaſon of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between them is, becauſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to men, who cannot diſcern Hearts and Thoughts, and the neceſſity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Affairs, or the negligence of Church-Governours, looſening the Reins of Diſcipline, many bad men continue in the viſible Communion of the Church, either becauſe they are not known, or becauſe when known, they are not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93053:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>through the Neglect of Church-Officers, or cannot through the Iniquity of the Times, be caſt out. And therefore the viſible Church in Scripture is called the Body, the Spouſe of Chriſt, the Wife of the Lamb, a royal Prieſthood, a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nation, a peculiar People, pure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, holy; and by ſuch like Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of peculiar Sanctity, with reſpect to what the Church is in its original Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and what it actually is in its true and ſincere Members, not regarding what ſome viſible Profeſſors are, who are in the Church indeed, but are not of it, and ought not to be in it. The not obſerving of which, has occaſioned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Divines to aſcribe all ſuch Titles and Characters, not to the viſible, but to the myſtical and inviſible Church, which in many Caſes is the Reaſon of ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Miſtakes.</p>
               <p>But then all Hereticks, and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and excommunicated Perſons, are out of this Church, till they either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, or be reſtored to the Communion of it. For to be in the Church, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to live in the Communion of it, and to have a Right to actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in ſome or all Chriſtian Offices: And therefore thoſe, who either by their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93053:43"/>own Choice, or by the Cenſures of the Church, are not in Communion, muſt be out of it. And nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in all Church-Writers, both anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern, than to meet with ſuch Expreſſions as theſe; of ſeparating from the Church, going out of it, being out, and being caſt out of the Church; which is a very ſtrange way of ſpeaking, if Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s Notion be true, That all profeſſed Chriſtians, what-ever they are, are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick Church; for then it is impoſſible for a profeſſed Chriſtian, either to go out, or to be caſt out of the Catholick Church, as it is for a man to go out of the World.</p>
               <p>This is that one Catholick Church, and Catholick Communion, which I aſſerted and proved in the <hi>Defence,</hi> from whence Hereticks and Schiſmaticks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and go out, and the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate are caſt out.</p>
               <p>But now the Difficulty is, Whither theſe Hereticks and Schiſmaticks go, when they go out of the Church. They cannot go into the World of Infidels and Unbelievers, for Hereſie and Schiſm does not make men Infidels; and if they be neither in the Church nor in the World, what third State ſhall we find for them?</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:93053:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The plain Reſolution of which in ſhort is this, That they are the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, which is a kind of middle State between the true Catholick Church, and the World of Infidels.</p>
               <p>They have not wholly renounced Chriſtianity, and therefore in ſome ſenſe belong to the Chriſtian Church, though they are not in it. There ſeems to be the ſame difference between Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, and Catholick Chriſtians, as there is between Rebels and dutiful Subjects: They are both natural Subjects to their Prince, as being born in his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and under the ſame Oaths of Allegiance; Rebels are not Aliens and Foreigners, but Subjects ſtill. Thus He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Schiſmaticks, though they have corrupted the Chriſtian Faith, and divided the Church, yet they have the Character of Chriſtian Baptiſm, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther retain the Chriſtian Faith entire, or ſo much of it as will denominate them Chriſtians: They may have the Power of Orders, Officers rightly conſtituted, Chriſtian Sacraments, and all the Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of a true Church, excepting Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Peace and Unity, and Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. This was the Caſe of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſt</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:93053:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>Churches, which were in all things like the Catholick Churches, excepting Catholick Communion.</p>
               <p>Upon this ſcore many learned men own corrupt Churches, which retain the Eſſentials of the Chriſtian Faith, though mixed and blended with many Errors, and ſchiſmatical Churches, which retain the Purity of Faith and Worſhip, to be true, though not every way ſound and orthodox, nor Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Churches: Which I hope will ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be acknowledged to be a true Church, and yet both corrupt and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical.</p>
               <p>There is one Diſtinction, which is not ſo commonly obſerved, which will make all this Diſpute plain and eaſie: And that is, between the viſible Church, and the one true Catholick viſible Church. The viſible Church compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all Societies of profeſſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans whatſoever, Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Idolaters, or whatever they be; the one viſible Catholick Church contains only thoſe Churches, which are ſound in the Faith, and live in Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; theſe viſible Churches are Chriſtian Churches by outward Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93053:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>but not Parts or Members of the one Catholick Church, which is the Body and the Spouſe of Chriſt, as <hi>Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> obſerves, <hi>that beſides one Church, which is the Catholick Church, the other Churches of Hereticks, are thought to be Churches, but are not;</hi> that is, they have the viſible Appearance of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſo are viſible Churches, as bad men are viſible Chriſtians by a viſible profeſſion;<note place="margin">Praeter unam quae eſt vera Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica, caeterae apud Hereticos pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur eſſe, non ſunt <hi>Opt. l. 1.</hi>
                  </note> but they are not ſuch Churches, as Chriſt will own,<note place="margin">Quae ſit una Eccleſia, quam Columbam &amp; Sponſam ſuam Chriſtus appellat. <hi>Id. l. 2.</hi>
                  </note> as he adds in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, that <hi>there is but one Church, which Christ calls his Dove and Spouſe.</hi> So that in this Senſe men may be viſible Chriſtians, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church, and yet not Members of the one Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>The not obſerving this, occaſioned St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s, and the <hi>African</hi> Fathers miſtake about the Rebaptization of thoſe, who were Baptized by Hereticks or Schiſmaticks, and upon this very Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, our Diſſenters at this day diſpute the validity of Orders received in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſo often twits us with deriving our Succeſſion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93053:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>from <hi>Rome,</hi> which if it were true, is no Objection againſt us, unleſs he will wholly unchurch the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and aſſert that, which Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> charges me with; that Hereſie or Schiſm does deſtroy all relation to the Church; for if they belong to the Church ſtill, they may retain the Power of Orders, and the Adminiſtration of Sacraments among them.</p>
               <p>And therefore to confirm this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will not be amiſs to give a plain and ſhort Account of the State of that ancient Controverſie, about the Rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization of Hereticks, as it was managed by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Austin,</hi> as far as concerns our preſent Diſpute.</p>
               <p>Now, 1. Both St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> were agreed, that there is but one Catholick Church, which is the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Spouſe of Chriſt; this is ſo acknowledged by all men, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Writings, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Tracts, <hi>De unitate Eccleſiae,</hi> That I ſhall not need to tranſcribe any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sayings to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were agreed alſo, that there is no Salvation ordinarily to be had out of the Communion of this one Catholick Church. Both of them do
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93053:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>over and over affirm this,<note place="margin">Salus, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, extra Eccleſiam non eſt, quis negat? <hi>Auguſt.</hi> de Baptiſmo contra Donat. <hi>l. 4. cap. 17,</hi>

               <p>But, 3.

               <p>HAving thus vindicated my Notion of Catholick Communion, from the Exceptions of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> before I proceed any farther, it will be highly expedient to diſcourſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing briefly of the neceſſity of it; for I find Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> mightily puzled to conceive, that thoſe who believe in Chriſt and repent of their ſins, and lead an holy Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty, as they ſuppoſe many may do, who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and do not live in Catholick Communion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Notion of it, ſhould for this Reaſon be excluded from all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Means of Salvation. They look upon the Chriſtian Religion to be like a Syſtem of Philoſophy, and if men be careful to believe ſuch Laws, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regard to a Church-ſtate, or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unity and Communion, their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93053:53"/>is very ſafe, and they have a Right and Title to all the Promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Holineſs of Life and a good Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind, is the only thing Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to promote by his Goſpel; and if men be holy, however they came by it, or whatever they are beſides, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not. This is very plauſible, and a prevailing Notion in our days, which makes a great many well-diſpoſed men extreamly indifferent, what Church they are of, ſo they be but watchful over their Hearts and Lives in other Matters: For will any man ſay, that a holy man ſhall not go to Heaven, when all the Promiſes of the Goſpel are made to ſuch Perſons?

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93053:53"/>Frugal, but a Heretick</hi> (which in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Language in that Place ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Schiſmatick) of ſuch a Perſon he ſays, <hi>That no man doubts, but for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cauſe, that he is a Schiſmatick, he ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> This it ſeems, was not St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s private Opinion, but the received Opinion of all Chriſtians in his days; that which no Body then doubted of: which makes it at leaſt worthy of our moſt ſerious and impartial Enquiry; and were men once throughly ſatisfied of the danger of Schiſm, and the abſolute neceſſity of Catholick Communion, a great many wanton Scruples, which now divide and ſubdivide the Church, would vaniſh of themſelves; for they would be then afraid to venture their Souls in a Schiſm. And therefore to make this as plain and evident as poſſible I can, I ſhall proceed by theſe following Steps; only premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, That the whole deſign of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is pure Charity to the Souls of men, not to triumph in their Ruine and Miſery; for God forbid, I ſhould ever rejoyce in the thoughts of any Man's Damnation; for then I am ſure, I ſhould never go to Heaven my ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:93053:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="1">1. I obſerve then in the firſt Place, That though holineſs of Life is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Condition, yet it is not the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe of our Salvation: <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſs we ſhall never ſee God.</hi> But that holineſs carries any man to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is in vertue of the meritorious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and Interceſſion of Chriſt, and therefore unleſs we have a Covenant-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this Sacrifice, nothing elſe can ſecure us of our Reward.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Catholick Charity, which is exerciſed in Catholick Communion, is a principal Part of Evangelical Holineſs, without which nothing elſe will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God. Love and Charity is the great Goſpel-Command, and the peculiar Badge of the Chriſtian Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and Chriſtian Charity, as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from good Nature, and an obliging Temper and Converſation, which is indeed a neceſſary moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but not that which is peculiarly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtian Charity, does unite all Chriſtians together in one Body; is ſuch a Kindneſs for one another, as anſwers to that Tenderneſs and Sympathy, which the Members of the Natural Body have for each other: So that Chriſtian-chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty neceſſarily preſerves Chriſtian-unity
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93053:54"/>and Communion; and whoever rends and divides the Church, is void of this Chriſtian-charity.</p>
               <p>This I have already proved at large in my Defence of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defence, p. 183. &amp;c.</note> both from Scripture and the Ancient Fathers; and it were eaſie to add numerous Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations more to this purpoſe. This is the principal thing St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> inſiſts on: he frequently applies that of the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. where he ſhews how unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able all other Attainments are without Charity,<note place="margin">Aug. de baptiſmo. <hi>l. 1. cap. 9. l. 3. cap. 16.</hi> &amp; alibi paſſim.</note> to ſignifie ſuch a Charity as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Peace and Communion of the Church; and does every where aſſert, that that man is void of Charity, who does not love the Peace and Unity of the Church: if then Chriſtian Charity be ſo neceſſary a part of Chriſtian Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and conſiſts in preſerving the Peace and Unity and Communion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, whatever other good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities Schiſmaticks may have, they want the chief branch of Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though a holy man ſhall never miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, or fall ſhort of Heaven, yet a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick with all his other good Qualities may.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:93053:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="3">3. Since the beſt men muſt be ſaved by Chriſt, and not by their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs or Merits, we muſt expect to be ſaved by Chriſt only in ſuch a way, as he himſelf has appointed; It is all free Grace, and therefore we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to receive it in ſuch a way, as he is pleaſed to give it. He is a Debtor to no man, and therefore may well be allowed to make his own terms; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is a ſupernatural State of Happineſs, which the beſt Man, ſetting aſide the conſideration of his many Imperfections and Defects, cannot challenge as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his beſt Services; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is under no other Obligation to beſtow Heaven on any man, but his own Promiſe made to us in Chriſt Jeſus, and therefore can be obliged no farther than his own Promiſe reaches: If any hard and pityable Caſe happens, he has the ſoveraign Power in his own hand, and can do, as he himſelf pleaſes, but we muſt expect no more from him, than he has promiſed.</p>
               <p>The not conſidering this, is apt to confound mens Notions concerning the undertaking of our Saviour, and our Redemption by him: It runs ſome men into Socinianiſm, to deny the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93053:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Chriſt; and others, who cannot be ſo ſubtil, as to diſtinguiſh themſelves out of ſo plain and expreſs an Article of our Faith, and therefore do heartily and ſincerely believe the Satisfaction of our Saviour, that he dyed as a true and proper Sacrifice to expiate our ſins, and purchaſe Eternal Life for us, yet have no clear Conceptions of the Reaſon of this, which will not well comply with thoſe other Notions they have of God, and his natural Obligation, not to call it natural Neceſſity, to love and reward good men.</p>
               <p>I do as firmly believe God's Goodneſs to good men, and his Love to true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, where-ever he ſees it, as I do any Article of my Creed, but then I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Heaven is a ſupernatural Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and not the natural Reward of an earthly Creature, as man by Nature is: And therefore the beſt man, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a Man, has no more reaſon to expect, That God as a Reward of his Vertue, ſhould tranſlate him from Earth to Heaven, than that he ſhould give him wings to flie in the Air, and to viſit the ſeveral Planets; all that can be expected from God upon account of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Juſtice of his Nature, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93053:56"/>ſuch a Happineſs on innocent or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Creatures, as their Natures were made for, that is, an earthly Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on an earthly Creature, which was all that was promiſed <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, an immortal, happy Life in this World.</p>
               <p>So that if we conſider the State of mankind, we ſhall find, that the whole Work of our Redemption, is wholly owing to free Grace, that is, that which was neither due to our Natures, nor what we could reaſonably expect from God, conſidered only as our Maker.</p>
               <p>Man in Innocence was but an earthly Creature,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>the firſt</hi> Adam <hi>was of the Earth and earthy;</hi> And an earthly Creature cannot challenge as his natural Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, an heavenly and divine ſtate of Life: <hi>For Fleſh and Blood,</hi> though inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and pure, <hi>cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> A groſs, earthly Body cannot aſcend into Heaven, nor dwell in thoſe pure Regions of Light, and therefore ſuch a Creature can no more challenge Heaven, as its natural Portion and Inheritance, than it can, that God ſhould change its Nature, and refine an earthy into a ſpiritual Body.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:93053:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>If we conſider man in his lapſed State, he has forfeited even an earthly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and cannot now challenge an immortal Life in this World, much leſs in the next; For what natural Reaſon can there be, when we ſuffer Death as the Puniſhment of ſin, for God, to raiſe our dead Bodies out of the Duſt again into an immortal Life. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the Reward of Vertue in this World, an immortal Life after Death cannot be the natural Reward of it; for then it could not be in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Notion of it, the Gift of God, or the Purchaſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And we may conſider farther, that as man is now deſigned for a ſupernatural ſtate of Happineſs in Heaven, ſo much advanced above the original ſtate of humane Nature, ſo there is required a divine Holineſs and Vertue to fit and qualifie him for this ſupernatural Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Upon this account our Saviour ſo earneſtly preſſes the Neceſſity of the new Birth, that we muſt be born of Water and of the Spirit, if we would enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven: <hi>For that which is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh, but that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit:</hi> Whereby our Saviour ſignifies to us, that we muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93053:57"/>to ſuch a pitch of Goodneſs, as is as much above the original Attainments of an earthly and fleſhly Nature, as Heaven is above the Earth: For that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh,</hi> is true in a ſtate of Innocency; Innocent fleſh is fleſh ſtill, and therefore we muſt be born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a diviner State than innocent fleſh, if we would enter into Heaven; that is, we muſt attain to ſuch a divine and ſpiritual frame of Mind, as raiſes us above this World, and prepares us for an Angelical ſtate of Life: For there are different degrees of Vertue fitted to the different ſtates of a reaſonable Nature: Unleſs we will ſay, that the Vertue of a Man, and of an Angel is the ſame. That degree of Vertue which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to teach a Man to uſe the good things of this World innocently and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, is not ſufficient to raiſe a Man above the World, and to make him contemn all bodily Pleaſures and earthly Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions.</p>
               <p>The higheſt and nobleſt Attainments of Chriſtianity would be no Vertues in an earthly ſtate: Were we to live always happily in this World; were this the beſt and moſt perfect ſtate we could expect,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93053:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>it would be no Vertue, but a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Folly to deſpiſe the good things of this Life, and to live above them: For in ſuch a State, the delights and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of Fleſh and Senſe would be an eſſential part of our Happineſs, and whatever is ſo, cannot and ought not to be deſpiſed: It always becomes a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature to govern all his appetites and deſires by the Laws of Reaſon, and to mortifie and ſubdue his inordinate Affections, as that ſignifies to correct the Extravagancies of them; but yet in an earthly ſtate he may indulge himſelf to the full in all lawful Enjoyments, and is not bound to lay reſtraints upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor to endeavour to ſtifle and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his ſenſual Inclinations, nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them their proper and natural ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions: That is, he who is to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in this World, and has no bigger or diviner Happineſs to expect, is not bound to die to this World, while he lives in it. So that all thoſe Evangelical duties of Self-denial and Mortification, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this World, and heavenly Mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, can be no Vertues nor Duties in any earthly ſtate, much leſs a life of Faith, and hope of unſeen things, when we have no unſeen things promiſed to us,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93053:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>as the Object of our Faith and Hope, but have our Portion at preſent, and expect only a circular and endleſs Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the ſame Enjoyments. The Laws of Vertue muſt be proportioned to the State and Condition of Man-kind, and muſt alter and vary with it; that which becomes an earthly Creature, who is to live always in this World, and in this Body, which as far as we know, was the Original ſtate of Man-kind, does not become one, who muſt put off this Body, and lives in this World, not as his home, and place of reſt, but as a probation-ſtate, for a better and more ſpiritual Life. That Vertue, which teaches us how to live happily in this World, and that which muſt prepare us for the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the next, muſt differ as much as Earth and Heaven, as Fleſh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And this I take to be the true dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Moral Vertue, and Evangelical Graces; the firſt is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the ſtate of a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, inhabiting an earthly Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any expectations of a more Divine and Spiritual Life, the ſecond includes a Reſpect to the other World, and that Angelical Happineſs, which Chriſt has promiſed to his ſincere Diſciples.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:93053:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The Religion then of our Saviour, being as much above Nature, as that Glory and Happineſs is, which is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and promiſed in the Goſpel, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary we ſhould have ſome more divine Principle to raiſe us into this divine Life, than meer Nature is; for Nature can never act above it ſelf; and that the Goſpel tells us, is the holy Spirit of God, whereby we are Renewed and Sanctified, and have the divine Nature formed in us; and this being above Nature, no conſidering man will ſay, that the Gift of the Holy Spirit is owing to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or that God is under any natural Obligation, as our Maker, to beſtow it on us.</p>
               <p>The Reſult of which is this, that the Gift of the Holy Spirit, whereby we are born again, and prepared and qualified for a divine and immortal ſtate of Life, being an act of pure Grace, and wholly owing to the Mediation of Chriſt, God may diſpence it upon what terms, and in what manner he pleaſes, and we muſt expect it only in that way, which God has appointed for the beſtowing of it.</p>
               <p>I need not inſiſt now on the Pardon of our ſins, which all Mankind own to be an Act of Grace, which we can upon
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93053:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>no account challenge without a Promiſe, nor upon any other Terms and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor in any other way, than what is promiſed.</p>
               <p>So that the whole Work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is an Act of pure Grace, which we cannot challenge from the natural Goodneſs of God, nor from his natural Relation to us, as we are his Creatures, and therefore muſt thankfully accept of it, in what way God pleaſes to give it, and not quarrel with him, if he do not give it to thoſe, who will not have it in his way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And therefore I obſerve in the next Place, That all the Bleſſings of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are promiſed to us in a Church-ſtate. This is ſo fully,<note place="margin">Diſcourſe of our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. to Chriſt. Chap. 4. ſect. 1. 142 Defence, &amp; Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuat. c. 5. <hi>p.</hi> 399.</note> and hitherto ſo unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably proved by Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> in his Diſcourſe of our Union and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Jeſus Chriſt, and in his Defence and Continuation of that Diſcourſe in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> that would men be at the Pains to turn to thoſe Books, there need be nothing ſaid to it here; however that this Treatiſe may not be wholly defective in ſo material a Point, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething briefly to it, and refer thoſe, who have a mind to ſee this Matter more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93053:59"/>to the aforeſaid Diſcourſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Then, That Chriſt did intend to erect a Church in the World, and to unite all his Diſciples into one Religious Society, is ſo univerſally acknowledged, that it is a needleſs trouble to prove that which no body denies; no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that Chriſt has a Church, and that he intended to have one, only the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers know not where to find it, now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, if Chriſt have inſtituted a Church, wherein he requires all his Diſciples to communicate as Members of the ſame Body, it goes a great way towards prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the ordinary Means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are to be had only in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this Church; for to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is this Church inſtituted, if not for a common Body and Society of thoſe, who ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt? No So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety can be founded or maintained but by ſuch Priviledges and Immunities, as make it deſirable to enter into it, and continue in it; without this all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Common-wealths, Cities, and Families would disband, for nothing can tie men together, who are naturally giddy, and fond of Innovations, but ſome ſenſible Advantages, which they cannot otherwiſe enjoy. And therefore
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93053:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Church being a ſpiritual Society, and the great end of its Inſtitution, the Salvation of ſinners, it is not reaſonable to think, that Chriſt would inſtitute a Church, without obliging Chriſtians to preſerve the Peace and Unity of it, at the Peril of their Souls, if they do not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And therefore I farther obſerve, That the Goſpel-Covenant is the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereon the Church is founded. The Blood of Chriſt is the Blood of the Covenant, the Covenant of Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purchaſed and ſealed by the Blood of Chriſt; and therefore let us conſider, whether this Covenant be made with particular men, conſidered as ſingle and ſcattered Individuals; or as incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a Church. Now in general we are told, that Chriſt <hi>is the Saviour of the Body,</hi> and that he has <hi>redeemed his Church with his own Blood,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines the Effects and Application of his Grace, and Merit, and Satisfaction to his own Body, which is the Church. But beſides this we may conſider, That the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was Typical of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, nay indeed, that it is the ſame Church ſtill, only enlarged and Chryſtianized; for the Chriſtian Church
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93053:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>is built upon the foundations, not only of the Apoſtles, but Prophets; and Jews and Gentiles are united into one Church, by breaking down the middle wall of partition, and engrafting the Gentiles upon the ſame Root and Stock with them, as I diſcourſed at large in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Dr. Stillingfleet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we know the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Covenant was made with the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as a Nation, whom God had choſen for himſelf of the Seed and Poſterity of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Natural <hi>Jews</hi> had no Title to this Covenant, till they were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and incorporated into the Body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> conſidered as in Covenant with God, of which Circumciſion was the Sign and Seal; and no ſtrangers were admitted to theſe priviledges of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, till they were engrafted into the Body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Circumciſion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one People with them: So that the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Covenant, which was but the Chriſtian Covenant in Types and Figures, was confined to a particular Nation, or Body of men, and to all thoſe, who were incorporated into the ſame Body with them; now it is plain, that the Chriſtian Church is incorporated into the Body of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtles call
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93053:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Chriſtians, the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and all the Names of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are given to the Chriſtian Church. <hi>A choſen Generation, a royal Priesthood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> 
                  <hi>an holy Nation, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People:</hi> So that the Chriſtian Church is a Nation, and People pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to God, and choſen by him out of the reſt of the World, as the <hi>Jews</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were, that is, united to God and to each other in the ſame Covenant, and therefore as the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Covenant was confined to the Body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that no Strangers or Aliens had any right to it, ſo is the Goſpel Covenant confined to the Communion of the Chriſtian Church: And therefore Chriſt is ſaid to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purifie to himſelf a peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, zealous of good Works. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3. To confirm this, we may conſider, that it is not enough that Chriſt has died for us, and purchaſed the Pardon of our ſins, and the Gift of the holy Spirit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this Pardon and Grace be applyed to us in ſuch ways, as he has appointed.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93053:61"/>For it will not ſuffice, that we make Chriſt our own, by a fanciful Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Merits to our ſelves, which would quickly overturn the Church, and make the Inſtitutions of our Saviour ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeleſs things, as we ſee this conceit has in a great meaſure done already, but we muſt receive Chriſt and all his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, as he is pleaſed to beſtow them.</p>
               <p>Now that the holy Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper are by the Inſtitution of our Saviour, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Conveyances and Miniſtries of Grace, has been the univerſal Belief of the Chriſtian Church in all Ages; in Baptiſm we receive the Remiſſion of our ſins, and the Gift of the holy Spirit; and therefore we are ſaid, <hi>to be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> and <hi>to be born of Water and of the Spirit,</hi> and we are ſaid <hi>to be ſaved by the waſhing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 Titus 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and the renewal of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Lord's Supper Chriſt gives himſelf to us as the Bread of Life,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Sherlock's</hi> practical Diſcourſe of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. part 2.</note> which is the daily Food and Nouriſhment of our Souls, of which the Manna in the Wilderneſs was but a Type; <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing, which we bleſs, is the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> (that Blood
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93053:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>which was ſhed for the remiſſion of Sins) <hi>and the Bread which we break is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Body of Christ:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note> That is, in this holy Sacrament all the Merits of Chriſt's Death and Sufferings are made over to worthy Communicants. Here we receive the freſh Supplies of the holy Spirit,<note place="margin">Ch. 12 13.</note> and therefore are ſaid <hi>to drink into one Spirit;</hi> but I need not inſiſt on the proof of that, which no body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, who has any Reverence for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Inſtitutions, and does not think them meer empty Shadows, and inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>If then our Saviour has appointed theſe holy Sacraments as the Means and Conveyances of Grace, and theſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ineffectual to thoſe, who do not live in the Unity and Communion of the Chriſtian Church, then we cannot ordinarily expect the Application of Chriſt's Merits to us, or the Vertue of his Death and Paſſion, out of Catholick Communion.</p>
               <p>And yet this was as generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the ancient Fathers, as the other, as I have already ſhown: St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> would not acknowledg, that Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks had any Sacraments, no more, than that they had any Church; St.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93053:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> acknowledged that they had Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, but <hi>inutiliter;</hi> their Schiſm made the Sacraments ineffectual to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the end for which they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; and indeed the very Nature of the Sacraments will eaſily ſatisfie us, that it muſt be ſo.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm is the Sacrament of Pardon and Forgiveneſs, of our Regeneration and new Birth by the holy Spirit; but it is the Sacrament alſo of our initiation and incorporation into the Chriſtian Church: And upon this very account our ſins are forgiven in Baptiſm; and the holy Spirit is beſtowed on us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes us the Members of Chriſt's Body, that is, of his Church, to whom the Forgiveneſs of ſins, and the Gift of the holy Spirit is promiſed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who are baptized in a Schiſm, and are no ſooner made the Members of Chriſt's Church, but do immediately divide and ſeparate themſelves from its Communion, if they do receive remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Sins, and the Gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the inſtant wherein they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> ſuppoſes they may, yet do immediately forfeit it again by their Schiſm: For the ſame Sacrament muſt have its entire effect, or none at
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93053:63"/>all; Incorporation into the Chriſtian Church, and forgiveneſs of ſins, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably united in Baptiſm, as God's and man's part is in the ſame Covenant: Incorporation into the Chriſtian Church, which is ſignified, repreſented, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in Baptiſm, is our part of the Covenant, our choice and reſolution, and actual undertaking of Chriſtianity, which is done by a Profeſſion of our Faith in Chriſt, and ſubjection to him, and by uniting our ſelves to the Society and Fellowſhip of his Church, by ſuch a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Right, as he has appointed for that purpoſe: Forgiveneſs of ſin, and the Gift of the holy Spirit, is God's part of the Covenant, who has promiſed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the Sins, and renew and ſanctifie thoſe with his Spirit, who thus ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devote themſelves to the Faith and Obedience of a crucified Jeſus, and therefore theſe two can never be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, unleſs God will perform his Part of the Covenant, whether we perform ours or not.</p>
               <p>Thus the holy Supper of our Lord does as plainly repreſent the Unity of the Chriſtian Church, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all Chriſtians with each other, as it does their Union to Chriſt, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93053:63"/>participation of the Merits of his Death and Sufferings: For the Apoſtle tells us, there is but one Bread, as there is but one Body; <hi>For we being many,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.17.</note> 
                  <hi>are one Bread and one Body, for we are all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that one Bread:</hi> And upon this account it is called <hi>the Communion of the Body of Chriſt,</hi> and therefore the Body of Chriſt cannot be received in a Schiſm; for where there is a Schiſm, it is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>one Bread and Body,</hi> nor the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Christ</hi>'s <hi>Body,</hi> when it is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into different and oppoſite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions. That which is the common Bread of all Chriſtians, muſt be received in Unity and one Communion; for it loſes its Nature, Vertue, and Efficacy, in a Schiſm. Thus the Paſchal Lamb, which was a Type of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion, and of the Chriſtian Feaſt of the Lord's Supper, as it was to be eaten by the whole Body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo every particular Lamb was to be eaten in one Houſe, and nothing to be carried out of it.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of all the other Means of Grace, which cannot avail any man, who does not live in the Peace and Communion of the Church: Our Prayers are effectual only in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93053:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>Merits of Chriſt's Sacrifice and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and if ſuch men have no intereſt in the Sacrifice of Chriſt, as they cannot have, if they have no Title to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Lord, which is the Chriſtian Feaſt upon the Sacrifice of the Croſs, and applies the Merits and Vertue of it to us, then their Prayers cannot be preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent neither; and if our Saviour would not allow any man to offer any Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, who had a private quarrel with his Brother, till he had reconciled himſelf to him, how unlikely is it, that God will hear the Prayers of thoſe men, who are at variance with the Church of God, and divide the Communion of it.</p>
               <p>As for hearing and reading, <hi>Paul</hi> may Plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> may Water, but it is God, that gives the Increaſe, and if God deny his Grace and Spirit to ſuch external Miniſtries, they can avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet we have already heard, how little reaſon ſuch men have to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that Chriſt <hi>gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangelists, and ſome Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints for the Work of the Miniſtry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Epheſ. 11, 12.</note> but the end of all is, <hi>For the edifying of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93053:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>body of Christ:</hi> So that all Miniſterial Gifts are for the edification of Chriſt's Body, which ſuppoſes, that their efficacy and influence is confined to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, and does not reach the Conventicles of Schiſmaticks. And he adds, <hi>But ſpeaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is Christ the Head, from whom the whole body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which every joynt ſupplyeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the effectual working in the Meaſure of every Part, maketh increaſe of the Body, to the edifying of it ſelf in Love.</hi> So that the Increaſe and Edification of Chriſtians is in the Unity of the Church, and conſiſts in the encreaſe of brotherly Love and Chriſtian Charity, Vertues which cannot be learn't in a Schiſm, nor preſerved in it, a bitter zeal, and enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed Paſſions, and uncharitable Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Surmiſes, and evil ſpeaking, and an inſolent contempt of all, who are not of their Party and Faction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt uſual fruits of a Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Reformation.</p>
               <p>All the Metaphors whereby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of Grace from Chriſt to his Church is repreſented in Scripture, do plainly ſignifie that this is done in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93053:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſuch as the influences which the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy receives from the Head, or the Branches from the Vine, which do not reach thoſe Members which are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Body, nor thoſe Branches, which are broken off from the Vine.</p>
               <p>The reſult of what I have ſaid, is this, If Holineſs be not the meritorious Cauſe, but only the condition of our Salvation, and therefore cannot ſave us, ſeparated from rhe Merits of Chriſt; if Catholick Unity, that is, Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, be one main eſſential part of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Holineſs, without which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe will be accepted by God; if the Work of our Redemption from firſt to laſt, be an Act of free Grace, which we cannot challenge from God, as due to our Natures, nor as a neceſſary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his own Goodneſs, conſidered as our Maker; and therefore is as entirely at God's choice, in what way, and upon what conditions he will diſpence it, as it was, whether he would do any ſuch thing at all; if we muſt expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Bleſſings of the Goſpel only in ſuch ways, as God hath appointed, and if Chriſt hath confined all the Grace of the Goſpel to a Church-ſtate; this is ſufficient to ſatisfie any unprejudiced
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93053:65"/>man, how neceſſary Catholick-unity and Communion is, without which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not upon any good grounds hope for the pardon of our Sins, the influences of God's Grace, or eternal Life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But there are ſome men, who will never be ſatisfied by the moſt clear and demonſtrative Proofs, that a thing is ſo, unleſs they can ſee the Reaſon why it ſhould be ſo; a way which of late has mightily prevailed, and has in a great meaſure thruſt all revealed and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Religion out of the World. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always give the natural Reaſons of things, not becauſe there are none, but becauſe they lie too deep for us to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, and if we cannot fathom Nature, which is more expoſed to our view and obſervation, how unreaſonable is it to think to fathom the unſearchable Counſels of God, in ſuch Matters as wholly depend upon his Soveraign Will, and have no apparent Cauſe, but his own good pleaſure: Matters of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be diſcovered only by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in ſuch Acts of ſoveraign Grace, it is abundantly ſufficient, if God tell us what he will do for us, and in what way he will do it, without aſſigning the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why he does ſo.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:93053:66"/>
               <p>But yet to ſatisfie theſe men, as much as may be, let them but aſſign a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why Chriſt would have a Church, and why he would have but one Church, and I will give them a manifeſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Reaſon, why Salvation ſhould be confined to the Communion of this Church, and that is, becauſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to preſerve the Unity, Diſcipline, or Government of the Church without it.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Church conſidered as a Church, is not armed with any ſecular coercive Power, and if it have no ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Power neither, how ſhall it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and preſerve it ſelf againſt all the oppoſitions of Men and Devils? and yet it can have no ſpiritual Power, if men may as well be ſaved out of the Church, as in it: For who then will regard the Unity of the Church, value its Cenſures, or reverence its Authority and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Spiritual Power is exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Souls and Conſciences of men, and reſpects the Happineſs of the other World, as temporal Power Governs the outward man, and reſpects this preſent Life; now all the Power Chriſt hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his Church, is that, which we call the Power of the Keys, to take in, or
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93053:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>to ſhut out of the Church, which is no Power at all, if the Communion of the Church be ſo indifferent a thing, that men may be as ſafe out of the Church as in it. All the Cenſures of the Chriſtian Church, which are purely Spiritual, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect Church-communion, and therefore their Authority too depends upon the neceſſity of this Communion: Some were caſt out of the Church, others received into the Number of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, of which <hi>Albaſpinaeus</hi> reckons four degrees in the Primitive Church, which were the different Degrees of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from Chriſtian Communion; now how eaſily may a man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves no neceſſity of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, deſpiſe all this Authority, and all theſe Cenſures, and there can be no neceſſity of it, if our Souls be not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endangered by the want of it.</p>
               <p>And yet our Saviour calls this Power of receiving in, and ſhutting out of the Church, <hi>The Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven: I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">16 Mat. 19</note> 
                  <hi>and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> Now how can the Keys of the Church to let
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93053:67"/>in, or to ſhut out, be called the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, unleſs there be a neceſſary Relation between the Communion of the Church on Earth (which is alſo called the Kingdom of God) and the Kingdom of Heaven, that thoſe who are in the Communion of the Church, and have a Right to be in it, have a Title alſo to the Kingdom of Heaven, and that thoſe who are out of the Church, either by their own Choice, or by a juſt Cenſure, have no Title to the Kingdom of Heaven, and ſhall never enter into it. That the Church on Earth, and the Church in Heaven is but one Communion, and that no men are tranſplanted into the Church in Heaven, but from the Communion of the Church on Earth; upon which account the Peace of the Church, which was given to dying Perſons under Cenſures, was called the <hi>Viaticum,</hi> or a kind of Paſs into the other World: And when our Saviour ſo expreſly aſſerts, whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if by binding and looſing we will underſtand putting out, or receiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, it makes the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93053:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Church abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>And I farther obſerve, that what in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> is called the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and binding and looſing, is in St. <hi>John</hi> called retaining or remitting ſins, <hi>Whoſoever ſins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 20.23</note> 
                  <hi>they are remitted, and whoſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we expound this remitting and retaining ſins, by binding and looſing in the exerciſe of the Keys, as in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we muſt; then to remit ſins, is to reſtore men to the Peace and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, and to retain them, is to caſt men out of the Church, or to keep them under Church-cenſures; which is a plain demonſtration, that ſins are forgiven only in the Communion of the Church.</p>
               <p>So that whatever other Reaſons our Lord might have, in confining Salvation ordinarily to the Communion of the Church, among which the Promoting of Catholick Love and Charity among his Diſciples and Followers is none of the leaſt, which as I obſerved before, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be maintained and preſerved in a Schiſm; yet here is one manifeſt Reaſon for it, that the Authority, and Diſcipline,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93053:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Government of the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Church cannot well ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, does wholly depend on it.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt have inſtituted a Church, and inveſted it with ſuch Authority and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as is neceſſary to preſerve it ſelf, and to promote the great ends of Church-Society, and the Church, as a ſpiritual Society can have no other Power, and has no other given it by Chriſt, but what reſults from the neceſſity of Catholick Communion, we need not wonder, that the pardon of Sin, and the aſſiſtances of the divine Grace, and everlaſting Life, ſhould be confined to the Communion of the Church, becauſe the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Preſerve it ſelf, nor Govern its own Members, can neither Inſtruct, Reprove, nor Cenſure with any Authority and Effect, without this, which by the way ſhows us, how effectually thoſe men, who ſeparate from the Church, upon a pretence of purer Worſhip and a purer Diſcipline, overthrow and contradict their own pretences, and tear up the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foundations of all Church-authority; for if ſeparation from the Church be ſo ſlight and indifferent a Matter, there can be no Authority in the Church; for any man who is uneaſie, or humerſom,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93053:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>or ungovernable in the Communion of the Church, may leave it if he pleaſes, and joyn himſelf to ſome other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or ſet up a new Communion of his own, without any danger; and in this Caſe nothing can keep People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but ſome great Art and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their Guides, or ſome ſecular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, or arbitrary Covenants, and I think the Independents have great reaſon on their ſide to found a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, on a particular Church Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, if there be no neceſſity of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, as I have now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it; for if there be no eſſential and inherent Authority in the Church, there can be no other than what depends upon private Contracts.</p>
               <p>Now may we not as well wonder, why humane Laws inflict ſuch ſevere Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Rebels, whatever other good qualities they may have, as that Chriſt ſhould ſo ſeverely puniſh Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who may upon other Accounts paſs in the World for very good men; the Reaſon of both is the ſame, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Church and State is of ſuch mighty Conſequence, to the temporal and ſpiritual Happineſs of Mankind, and Rebellion and Schiſm ſo deſtructive to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93053:69"/>all Government, that thoſe men deſerve the ſevereſt Puniſhments, who diſturb the Peace and Eſtabliſhment of Church or State; and Schiſm is ſo much worſe than Rebellion, as the happineſs of the Souls of men, is of much greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, than their temporal Eaſe and Felicity.</p>

               <p>ANd now I am come to the main ſeat of the Controverſie, between me and Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> not to mention the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Conformiſt, who is ſuch an inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Appendage and Hanger-on, as a ſilly flie is to a Wheel, though poſſibly he may have no more wit, than to fancy that he has raiſed all this duſt and ſtir.</p>
               <p>They charge me with advancing a <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> deſign, and promoting an Union with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> rather than with Proteſtant Diſſenters. And to inſinuate the belief of this into his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93053:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>Readers, Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> endeavours to prove, that Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> had this deſign in his head; but what is this to me? I am no Arch-Biſhop yet, and greatly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, I never ſhall be; if he can prove that the Arch-Biſhop died like a Papiſt, or a Phanatick, with a lye in his mouth; or that he attempted any reconciliation with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is not conſiſtent with the Principles, or Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Primitive Church, I think he was very much to blame for it, and am very glad he did not perfect his Deſign; but could a Reconciliation be obtained upon the principles of Primitive and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Chriſtianity, accurſed be the man, who would hinder this Union, which I would be glad to effect, not only with ſhedding my Blood once, but if it were poſſible a thouſand times, with all the Scorn and Obloquies of the moſt virulent Phanaticks into the Bargain.</p>
               <p>But whatever Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> may fancy, I look upon this, as a very hopeleſs and impractible deſign, and never had ſuch a vain Conceit in my head, while I was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93053:70"/>I ſhould have been more puzzled, to have found out the Riſe and Occaſion of it, than to have anſwered all the Cavils againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which I have ever yet ſeen.</p>
               <p>But though I knew nothing of a <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandrian</hi> Deſign, yet my Adverſaries have found me out, and if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> I am got at leaſt as far as <hi>France,</hi> in my Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſurely there is ſome Conjuring in the Caſe, for I don't know, that ever I went a ſtep beyond <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But this is a Cauſe, which will not bear an Ignoramus, and therefore I muſt defend my ſelf as well as I can; and in order to that, I ſhall 1. briefly repreſent the Doctrine of the Defence, with reſpect to the Unity of Church-power and Government, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Charge of <hi>Caſſandrianiſm</hi> is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 2.

Examine the Arts my Adverſaries have uſed to pervert the Senſe of my words, to turn them into Non-ſenſe and Ridicule, and to draw me head-long into the Popiſh Plot.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the firſt, in order to prove that the Unity of the Catholick Church conſiſts in one Communion, I aſſerted,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93053:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>that all the Biſhops of the Church, are but one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, inveſted with the ſame Power and Authority to Govern the Church, that as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Defence of the unreaſ.of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. p. 208.</note> 
                  <hi>There is but one Epiſcopacy, part of which every Biſhop holds with full Authority and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi> That all theſe Biſhops are but one body, who are bound to live in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with each other, and to govern their reſpective Churches, where need requires, and where it can be had, by mutual advice and conſent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that no Biſhops are abſolutely inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, but are obliged to preſerve the Unity of the Epiſcopacy, or Epiſcopal Colledge, as <hi>Optatus</hi> calls it, whereon the Unity and Communion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church depends; for it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the Catholick Church ſhould be one Body or Society, or one Communion, if it be divided into as many indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Churches, as there are abſolute and independent Biſhops; for thoſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es muſt be independent, which have an independent Power and Government, as all thoſe muſt have, which have inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Governors or Biſhops, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Churches can never make one Body, and one Catholick Communion, becauſe they are not Members of each
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93053:71"/>other; and thus the Unity of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church muſt be deſtroyed, unleſs we aſſert one Epiſcopacy, as well as one Church, one Evangelical Prieſthood, as well as one Altar, all the World over.</p>
               <p>But to make this as plain as poſſibly I can, that every one may underſtand it, who will; I ſhall reduce the whole ſtate of this Controverſie, under ſome few heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is but one Epiſcopacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Biſhops of the Catholick Church have originally the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power in Church Affairs; no one has the whole, but each of them has a part and equal ſhare, and therefore they are called the Epiſcopal Colledge, and a copious Body of Biſhops, as all the Churches in the World are one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, not becauſe they ever do, or ought to meet together for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Counſel, and Acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all parts of the World; no more than the Catholick Church does for Acts of Worſhip; but becauſe they are, and ought to be in Communion with each other, they have all the ſame Power and Authority, which muſt be exerciſed in one Communion.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:93053:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. Though all Biſhops have a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole Church, every Biſhop being a Biſhop of the Catholick Church, yet the Rules of Order and good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Edification of the Church, require, that the Exerciſe of this Power be in ordinary Caſes limited and confined to a certain Part, which we call a particular Church, for as no particular Biſhop can Inſtruct and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Catholick Church, no more than he can be in all parts of the World at the ſame time, ſo every Biſhop will be capable of exerciſing his Office to the beſt Advantage, when his Care is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a certain Place, and particular Church; and every particular Church, is likely to receive the greateſt Benefit from the Care and Inſpection of a fixed Paſtor and Biſhop.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the ſame Rules of Order and Government, require, that every Biſhop have the chief Power of Government in his own Dioceſs, for if every Biſhop had Authority as often as he pleaſed, to intermeddle in another Biſhops Dioceſs, and order the Affairs of his Church, it muſt needs cauſe great Confuſion and Diſtraction in all Churches, and make the People very uncertain, whom they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93053:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>are to obey, and therefore it has been the conſtant Practice of the Apoſtles, and all ſucceeding Ages, to ſet Biſhops and Paſtors over particular Churches, and to confine their Care and Inſpection to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But yet the Power of every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in his own Dioceſs, is not ſo Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Independent, but that he is bound to preſerve the Unity of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, and to live in Communion with his Collegues, and Fellow-Biſhops; for this is the Foundation of Catholick Communion, without which, there can be no Catholick Church; and therefore he, who cauſeleſly breaks this Unity, can be no Catholick Biſhop; and this is the Foundation of all thoſe greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of Churches, and that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is regularly exerciſed over particular Biſhops by their Colleagues.</p>
               <p>For, 5. To preſerve the Peace and Unity of the Epiſcopacy, it is neceſſary, that every Biſhop do not only obſerve the ſame Rule of Faith, but eſpecially in matter of Weight and Conſequence, the ſame Cuſtoms and Uſages, and the ſame Laws of Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore it is highly expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and neceſſary, when any difficult
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93053:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>Caſe happens, for which they have no ſtanding Rule, to adviſe and conſult with each other, not as with ſuperior Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, who are to determine them, and give Laws to them, but as with Friends, and Colleagues, of the ſame Body and Communion. And this makes it highly reaſonable for neighbour Biſhops, at as great a diſtance, as the thing is practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with Eaſe and Convenience, as the Biſhops of the ſame Province, or the ſame Nation, to live together in a ſtrict Aſſociation and Confederacy; to meet in Synods, and Provincial or National Councils, to order all the Affairs of their ſeveral Churches by mutual Advice, and to oblige themſelves to the ſame Rules of Diſcipline and Worſhip; this has been the Practice of the Church from the very beginning, and ſeems to be the true Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Archi-Epiſcopal, and Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Churches, which were ſo early, that it is moſt probable, they had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in the Apoſtles days; for though all Biſhops have originally equal Right and Power in Church-Affairs, yet there may be a Primacy of Order granted to ſome Biſhops, and their Chairs, by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſent, and under the Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Eccleſiaſtical Canons, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93053:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Catholick Unity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, without any Antichriſtian En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments or Uſurpations on the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Authority.</p>
               <p>For, 6. This Combination of Churches and Biſhops does not, and ought not to introduce a direct Superiority of one Biſhop or Church over another, or of ſuch Synods and Councils over particular Biſhops: Every Biſhop is the proper Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of his own Dioceſs ſtill, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be regularly impoſed on againſt his Conſent; the whole Authority of any Biſhop or Council over other Biſhops is founded on the Laws of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which is the great end it ſerves, and therefore they have no proper Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but only in ſuch Matters, as concern the Unity of the Epiſcopacy, or the Peace and Communion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. If a Biſhop be convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of Hereſie or Schiſm, or ſome great Wickedneſs and Impiety, they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, and forbid his People to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with him, and ordain another in his ſtead, becauſe he ſubverts the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Faith, or divides the Unity of the Church, or is himſelf unfit for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion; But if a Biſhop dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from his Colleagues; aſſembled in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93053:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>or Provincial Councils, or one National or Provincial Council differ from another, in Matters of Prudence, and Rules of Diſcipline, without either corrupting the Faith, or dividing the Church, if we believe St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his Preface to the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> they ought not to deny him Communion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch accounts, nor to offer any force to him in ſuch Matters. Thus St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Father differed from <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Colleagues, about the re-baptization of Hereticks, but yet would not divide the Church, nor the Unity of the Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon that Score, for any Biſhop to diſſent from his Colleagues, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately adhere to his own private Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without very great and neceſſary Reaſons for doing ſo, is great froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Inſolence, which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and cenſured; but while he preſerves the Unity of Faith, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, whatever Church or Council ſhould deny Communion to him, would be guilty of the Schiſm; which plainly ſhews, that there can be no conſtitutive Regent Head on Earth of a National, much leſs of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; ſince every Biſhop is the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93053:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſupreme Governor of his own Church, and though he may, and ought to take the Advice of neighbour Biſhops or Councils, yet he is not under their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, any farther than the Purity of the Faith, or the Unity of the Church is concerned; nor yet is ſo abſolute and independent, but that he is bound to live in Communion with his Colleagues, and as much as is poſſible, govern his Church by mutual Advice and Conſent, and if he divide the Church by Hereſie or Schiſm, he may be depoſed, and caſt out of Chriſtian Communion.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I have diſcourſed at large upon ſeveral occaſions in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and proved them from primitive Practiſe, and have now reduced them into this plain Method, that if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to prevent it, it may not be in the Power of my Adverſaries a ſecond time, to form a Popiſh or <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> Plot, out of ſuch Anti-<hi>Caſſandrian</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is time now to conſider, what <hi>Caſſander</hi> taught about this Matter. <hi>George Caſſander</hi> was a very learned and moderate Papiſt, who in Obedience to the Command of the Emperors, <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> and <hi>Maximilian,</hi> writ his Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93053:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>wherein he gives his judgment of every Article of the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was drawn up by <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and dedicated to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. The ſeventh Article concerns the Church, and there we muſt ſeek for his Judgment in this matter; and yet there I can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s purpoſe, who has na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Caſſander</hi> indeed, but not cited any one paſſage out of him.</p>

                  <hi>That to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Catholick Church is required obedience to one ſupreme Governor, who ſucceeds</hi> Peter <hi>in the Government of Christ's Church, and in the Office of feeding his Sheep, and that this is agreeable to the ſenſe of the Ancient Church.</hi> And that <hi>it is evident from all the Records of the Church, That the chief Authority in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church of Chriſt has always been yielded to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>as</hi> Peter's <hi>Succeſſor, who ſits in his Chair,</hi> For the Proof of which he refers us to the Teſtimonies of <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Tertullian, Optatus,</hi> and others,</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:93053:75"/>
               <p>It is very true, as Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> obſerves, that there have been ſome, who have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the Authority of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil above the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that this is a prevailing Opinion among the French Papiſts, and thence concludes, <hi>That ſuch as aſſert,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reply. p. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>that a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is the Political Head, or Regent part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church, are in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of French Papiſts;</hi> which is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his great Skill in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
               <p>For ſuppoſe there be any ſuch men, who aſſert a General Council, to be the Political Head or Regent Part of the Univerſal Church, but renounce all the pretended Authority of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all Communion with him; are theſe men Papiſts or not? If they be, then it ſeems, that thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Pope, may be Papiſts ſtill, and then let Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> and his Friends look to themſelves, who are in as fair a way of being Papiſts, as any men I know, notwithſtanding their renouncing the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and General Councils; if they be not Papiſts, then they are not French Papiſts, unleſs French Papiſts be no Papiſts.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:93053:75"/>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> if he had been at all acquainted with theſe Matters, would eaſily have perceived, that all who plead for the ſupreme Authority of General Councils, do not therein renounce the Authority of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore are Papiſts ſtill, call them <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> Papiſts, or what you pleaſe; and that thoſe, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Authority, and all depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Pope, can be no Papiſts, how zealous ſoever they are for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of General Councils.</p>
               <p>It were eaſie to diſcourſe largely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Argument, but a few plain Proofs are as good as a thouſand. Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> but if he had ever ſeen more than the Names of thoſe Councils, he would have found, how little they ſerved his purpoſe. I grant they do decree, that a General Council is above the Pope, in determining Matters of Faith, in compoſing Schiſms, and in reforming the Church in its Head and Members; but ſtill they attribute ſuch a ſoveraign Authority to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as no Power on Earth can equal, or match, but only a General Council. This is ſo evident and notorious, that whoever

               <p>The Sum of their Charge amounts to this; that I place the ſupreme govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power of the Church in a general Council, and that the Unity of the Church conſiſts in the Subjection of all particular Chriſtians and Churches to a general Council; and yet they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to acknowledg, that I diſown a Conſtitutive Regent Head of a National, or of the Univerſal Church: And here they cry out of Contradictions, and exerciſe their gueſſing faculty, what

               <p>As for Contradictions, I will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them anon, but the firſt thing to be done is to examine, what occaſion I have given them to think, that I place the ſupreme <hi>unifying Power</hi> (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls it) of the Church in a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>

                  </gap> Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> deny, that Biſhops or Presbyters have a Relation to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church?

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93053:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>of all Catholick Chriſtians, and Catholick Biſhops, is to the Catholick Church.

               <p n="2">2. That the ordinary Power of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Biſhop, or the Exerciſe of the Epiſcopal Office is confined to a certain place, or particular Church, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly does not make them the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Governors of the whole univerſal Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

And if Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> meant no more but this, by making the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church the firſt Seat of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that all the Power in the Church primarily reſpects the univerſal Church,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93053:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>though as it is diſtributed into different hands, the Exerciſe of it is confined to particular Places and Churches, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily own the Charge, and may do ſo ſafely without making the Church, ſuch an organized Political Body, as has one Conſtitutive Regent Head over the Whole.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I aſſert farther, That Biſhops being Miniſters of the Catholick Church, when Neceſſity, that is, when the preſervation of the Catholick Faith, or Catholick Communion, require it, may with one conſent oppoſe the Hereſie or Schiſms of neighbour Biſhops; depoſe thoſe, who are incorrigible; and Ordain others in their ſtead; and as far as it is poſſible take care, that no part of the Church of Chriſt ſuffer any injury by the Hereſie or evil Practiſes of any of their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues. And if Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> will hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that every Biſhop has an original Right to govern the whole univerſal Church, he muſt have a Logick by himſelf, or ſome great flaw in his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or Conſcience. Every Biſhop is a Biſhop of the univerſal Church, and therefore as far as the Rules of good Order and Government, Catholick Peace and Communion, and the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility

Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 11.</note> that I ſay, <hi>The Catholick Church is united and coupled by the Cement of Biſhops, who stick cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for which I produce</hi> Cyprian; and therefore I hope, there is no Popery in this, unleſs St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> alſo, were a <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandrian</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Papiſt. For may not Biſhops ſtick cloſe together in one Communion, unleſs there be a ſupreme Conſtitutive Regent Head of the Church? Or, can the Church be one, unleſs the Biſhops, who are the ſupreme Eccleſiaſtical Governors of their ſeveral Churches, be one alſo?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But I aſſert, <hi>that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Peace of the Epiſcopacy is maintained by their governing their Churches by mutual Conſent;</hi> Therefore not by one Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Regent Head. But he ſays, I mention, <hi>Collegium Epiſcopale,</hi> or <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Colledge,</hi> So indeed I obſerved <hi>Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> called the whole Body of Biſhops, and upon the ſame account, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Austin</hi> calls them Colleagues. But this <hi>Epiſcopal Colledge,</hi> he ſays, <hi>He
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93053:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>takes to be a Council of Biſhops,</hi> But that is his miſtake, and a very ſilly one it is; and he might as well conclude, that when the Fathers ſpeak of the Unity of the Epiſcopacy, they mean their Union in a general Council. In St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time there never had been a general Council, excepting the Council of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and yet, when he writ to Forraign Biſhops, with whom he was never joyned in Council, nor ever like to be, he calls them his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, or thoſe of the ſame Colledge with him; which ſignifies no more, but that they were of the ſame Power and Authority in the Church, and united in the ſame Communion.</p>
               <p>And yet Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> takes hold of this Phraſe of <hi>the Epiſcopal Colledge,</hi> to make me expreſly aſſert the ſupreme Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of general Councils.<note place="margin">p. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>That every part of the univerſal Church, is under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the univerſal Biſhops aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in their Colledge, or in Council.</hi> Which Sentence he very honeſtly puts into a different Character, that it may be taken for mine, and makes it a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct head of accuſation, when I never writ nor thought any ſuch thing; but this is the dealing we muſt expect from
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93053:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>thoſe men, whoſe Underſtandings and Conſciences are formed only to ſerve a party.</p>
               <p>Well, but <hi>theſe Biſhops have an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Right and Power in relation to the whole Church,</hi> this has been conſidered already, only he adds an untoward <hi>(i. e.)</hi> which is ſuch another honeſt Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as turning an Epiſcopal Colledge into a Council. For, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Lob, The Forraign Biſhops, as thoſe of</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria <hi>and</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c. have an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power and Right in relation to the whole Church, a Right and Power in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to</hi> England. Now this is very true in the ſenſe in which I aſſert it: The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> have ſuch a relation to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo have all the Biſhops in the World, that if they live in the ſame Communion with us, and ſhould come over into <hi>England;</hi> with the leave of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, they might exerciſe their Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Office in any Church in <hi>England;</hi> as <hi>Polycarp</hi> conſecrated in the Church of <hi>Anicetus</hi> at <hi>Rome:</hi> A Catholick Biſhop does not loſe his Character by going out of his own Church, but is a Biſhop in what part of the World ſoever he be; and therefore may exerciſe his Epiſcopal
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93053:83"/>Office, as far as is conſiſtent with the Rules of Order and Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and with the Rights and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of other Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Nay, were there nothing elſe to alter the Caſe, but only the local diſtance between <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria;</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> might admoniſh and cenſure the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bſhops, in caſe they fell into He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie or Schiſm, and deny them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in caſe of obſtinacy or incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibleneſs; and ſo may the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops admoniſh thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> and inflict the like Cenſures on them: The Unity of the Epiſcopacy conſiſts in one Communion, and all the Authority of the Church reſults from the neceſſary Obligations to Chriſtian Communion; and all Churches muſt judge for themſelves by the Rules of Catholick Communion, what Churches to hold Communion with; and though we muſt expect, while Biſhops are men, and ſubject to the Weakneſſes, Paſſions, Miſtakes of humane Nature, they may be guilty of great miſcarriages, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Communion to each other upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Reaſons; yet there is no help for this, that I know of, but either the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93053:84"/>Mediation and Interpoſition of other Churches, or an Appeal to the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That obligation all Churches are under, as far as in them lies, to preſerve the Purity of the Faith, and the Unity of the Church, obliges them to reject the Communion of thoſe, who violate either; but it withal obliges them, as they will anſwer it at the Tribunal of Chriſt, the great Biſhop of his Church, not to make any unneceſſary breaches, or lightly and wantonly refuſe each others Communion.</p>
               <p>But by the Original Right and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> or other Forraign Biſhops in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he ſeems to mean a Right of Appeals and proper Jurisdiction, as he plainly does in what he adds a little after, concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> on any Forraign Power: For becauſe I aſſert the Biſhops are not wholly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, he concludes, <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <hi>is not independent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reply, p. 12. p. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to Forraign Biſhops, if at any time they abuſe their Power.</hi> And ſome Pages after confutes this, by ſaying, That, <hi>'tis notorious, that the Church of</hi> England <hi>estaliſhed by Law, is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93053:84"/>National Church, independent on any Forraign Power whatſoever. Such is the Conſtitution of our Church, that what Biſhop ſoever is found an abuſer of his Power, he is not accountable to any Colledge of Biſhops, but ſuch us are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened by his Majesties Authority, and that what apprehenſions ſoever he may have of his being griev'd through any undue procedure, he cannot make any appeal to any Forraign Power from the King.</hi> And therefore he thinks, I incur a Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire, by ſetting up a Forraign Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this is ſo wild and abſurd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, from any thing I have ſaid, that none but Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> or ſome few of his ſize could have hit on't; there is but one Epiſcopacy in the Chriſtian Church, of which every Biſhop has an equal Share and Portion, and therefore is a Biſhop of the Catholick Church, and though the Exerciſe of his Epiſcopal Office and Authority, is regularly and ordinarily confined to a particular Church, yet his original Right and Power in relation to the whole Church does ſtill remain, <hi>i. e.</hi> He is a Biſhop in all parts of the World, and may exeroiſe his Epiſcopal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty where-ever he be, as far as is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93053:85"/>with the Rules of Order and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion; and when neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires, is obliged to take care, as far as poſſibly he can, that the Church of Chriſt ſuffer no injury by the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or evil Practiſes of any of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues; <hi>ergo,</hi> the <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>is ſubject to the Authority of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>or</hi> Alexandria. But I believe few men can diſcern, how ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence reſults from ſuch Premiſſes, and what follows, is of the ſame ſtamp.</p>
               <p>All Biſhops have originally equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church of Chriſt, but yet are not ſo independent, but that they are bound by the Laws of Chriſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Peace and Unity of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, and to live in Communion with their Fellow Biſhops, and in caſe of Hereſie, Schiſm, or notorious Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, may be cenſured and depoſed by their Colleagues, and others ordained in their ſtead, <hi>Ergo, The Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>is ſubject to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>or</hi> Alexandria, <hi>or other Forraign Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have abundantly proved in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> owns theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, but denies the Concluſion, and therefore either he, or Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> are out
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93053:85"/>in their Logick, when St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had Excommunicated two of his Presbyters, <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> and they fled to <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Cornelius</hi> to make their Complaints to him; St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes a Letter to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> wherein he informs him of the whole Matter, and has this remarkable paſſage in it: <hi>That it was by a general Conſent agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>From theſe inſtances it appears, that the Unity of the Epiſcopacy, or Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Colledge, does not give Authority to every Biſhop, to intermedle with the Affairs of another Biſhop's Dioceſs, but only in caſe of abſolute neceſſity, for here are two things to be diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, which qualifie each other, and ſet bounds to the Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 1. That there is but one Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, in which every Biſhop has an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſhare; Chriſt hath committed the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93053:86"/>Care of his whole Church to the Biſhops of it, who are to maintain Unity and Communion among themſelves, and as far as it is practicable, and as occaſion requires, govern the Church with mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Advice and Counſel, and one Conſent, as if they were but one Biſhop. And, 2. That every Biſhop has a Portion of the Flock aſſigned to his particular Care, over which in ordinary Caſes, he has the ſole and ſupreme Authority; for though the Church of Chriſt be but one Flock, yet it is not committed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Care of all Biſhops, but is divided into ſeveral Folds with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Paſtors ſet over them, to inſtruct and govern, and take Care of them; and as every Biſhop and Paſtor is more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly concerned, than any other, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an account of that part of the Flock committed to his Charge, ſo it is fit, he ſhould have the greateſt Authority and Power over them; all Biſhops have an equal Power and Authority in the Church, but the ordinary exerciſe of this is confined to their own Churches, in which each of them is ſupreme.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt of theſe, the Unity of the Epiſcopacy, is the foundation of thoſe larger Combinations and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracies
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93053:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>of neighbour Churches, which make Archiepiſcopalor National Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, for ſince there is but one Epiſcopacy, it is highly reaſonable and neceſſary, that as far as it is practicable (as it is in the Churches of the ſame Province or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) they ſhould all act, and govern their reſpective Churches, as one Biſhop, with one conſent; which is the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual way to ſecure the Peace and Unity of the Epiſcopal Colledge, and to promote the Edification and good Government of the Church.</p>
               <p>Nay, this Unity of the Epiſcopacy is the Foundation of that Authority, which neighbour Biſhops have over their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues in caſe of Hereſie and Schiſm, or any notorious Wickedneſs, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops of the univerſal Church, have an original Right and Power to take care, that no part of the Church, which is within their reach and inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuffer by the Hereſie or evil Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their Colleagues.</p>
               <p>But the ſecond Conſideration, that every Biſhop has the chief Power in his own Church, preſcribes the Bounds and Limits of this Eccleſiaſtical Authority; as, 1. Every Biſhop having the chief Power in his own Dioceſs, though he is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93053:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>bound by the Laws of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and in order to preſerve the Peace and Unity of the Epiſcopacy, to conſent with his Colleagues in all whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Conſtitutions, and Rules of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government; yet he cannot be impoſed on againſt his own Conſent by any Biſhop or Council of Biſhops, nor can juſtly be depoſed upon ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, while he neither corrupts the Faith, nor Schiſmatically divides the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor can any Biſhop or Biſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcind any Cenſures juſtly paſſed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhop againſt any in his own Church, or receive Appeals about ſuch Matters, without his Conſent; for the Unity of the Epiſcopacy requires all Biſhops to leave each other to the free Exerciſe of their Power and Authority in their own Churches, as we ſee the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledged in the Caſe of <hi>Marcion</hi>'s Appeal from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sentence: For it is an uſurpation on the Authority of Biſhops, not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to govern their own Flock, while nothing is done to the injury of the Faith, and the Churches Peace; and nothing is more likely to make infinite diviſions and quarrels between Biſhops,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93053:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>than for one Biſhop to undo, what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has done, or to judge over again that Cauſe, which has been already judged and determined, where it ought to be judged; as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus,</hi> as I obſerved above: I grant this is generally practiſed in Archiepiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal and National Churches, and in many Caſes there is great uſe and reaſon for it; but then this is not without the Conſent of other Biſhops; thoſe Appeals are allowed and confirmed by Provincial and National Synods, to which every Biſhop gives his Conſent, but I am now conſidering what the original Right of Biſhops is, not how far they may part with this Power for a more general good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As every Biſhop has the chief Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in his own Dioceſs, ſo much more has a larger Combination of Biſhops into a National Church, the ſupreme Power within it ſelf, from whence lies no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any Forraign Church, without its own Conſent.</p>
               <p>The Unity of the Epiſcopacy requires the Union of neighbour Biſhops for one Government; but becauſe all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the World, though they are of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93053:88"/>the ſame Communion, yet cannot be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited into one Government, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſtop ſomewhere, and that which in all reaſon muſt determine the bounds of ſuch a Church, muſt be a convenient diſtance of place, or one Nation, and one Civil Government, ſuch Churches being more eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated into one Body, than thoſe of different Nations. Now if every Biſhop be the ſupreme Governor of his own Church, much more has a National Church the ſupreme Power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf.</p>
               <p>A National Church is bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Catholick Communion with Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches, and if it fall into Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or Schiſm, Neighbour Churches may and ought to admoniſh and cenſure them; and if they continue obſtinate to withdraw Communion from them; but while a National Church preſerves the Unity of the Faith, and Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, no other Church can intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in its Government, nor ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Appeals from its Judgment; for no Biſhops or Churches have any Authority over each other, but only in order to Catholick Communion.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:93053:89"/>
               <p>Theſe things I have diſcourſed more largely on purpoſe, if it be poſſible to prevent the miſtakes of theſe men, who are ſo unwilling to ſee or to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Truth; and I hope I may ſafely conclude from the whole, that there is no danger, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſhould challenge any juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by vertue of the original Right and Power of the Catholick Biſhops in relation to the whole Church of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>But where do I ſay, <hi>That if any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops abuſe their Power, they are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a general Council?</hi> Truly no where, but he tranſcribes a long Paragraph out of the Defence, againſt the abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency of Biſhops, wherein there is this Expreſſion, <hi>And 'tis very wild to imagine, that any of theſe Perſons, who abuſe their Power, ſhould not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the reſt for it.</hi> i.e. <hi>to the Colledge of Biſhops;</hi> which laſt words are not mine, but his own Comment, though Printed in a different Character, as if they were mine; and this <hi>Colledge of Biſhops</hi> he transforms preſently into a general Council, and thus I ſubject the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whom I firſt equal to other Biſhops (as I do indeed with reſpect to original Right and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wherein all Biſhops are equal, not with reſpect to Church-conſtitutions) <hi>to ſome Court above any in this Realm, to a general Council, a Colledge of Biſhops,</hi> and now I am in danger again of a Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire.</p>
               <p>But this has been already ſufficiently explained, in what ſenſe I deny the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93053:90"/>of Biſhops, and how far this is from ſubjecting them to any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Juriſdiction, whether of Forraign Prelates, or a general Council, though I cannot well underſtand, how a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council, of which they themſelves are part, can be properly called a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Court, or Forraign Juriſdiction; unleſs the Treaty at <hi>Nimengen</hi> were a Forraign Juriſdiction to all thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States, who ſent their Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries thither to act for them.</p>
               <p>However to ſatisfie Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> I ſhall 1. freely declare my thoughts about a general Council. 2. Conſider the folly of that ſuggeſtion, that to aſſert the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a general Council, ſubverts the Kings ſupremacy, and incurs a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for a general Council, my thoughts are theſe, which I humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to my Superiors. 1. That there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, nor ever can be in a ſtrict ſenſe, a general and oecumenical Council of the whole Church, unleſs the Council of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was ſuch; which yet was not general, unleſs all the Apoſtles were there, which I ſuppoſe will not be eaſily proved; for it is not likely there ever ſhould be a Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93053:90"/>on of Biſhops from all parts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, nor if it were poſſible, that there ſhould be ſome few Biſhops diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht from all Chriſtian Churches all the World over, can I ſee any reaſon, why this ſhould be called a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, when it may be, there are ten times as many Biſhops, who did not come to the Council, as thoſe who did; and why ſhould the leſs. Number of Biſhops aſſembled in Council, judge for all the reſt, who ſo far exceed them in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and it may be are not inferior to them in Piety and Wiſdom: Eſpecially conſidering that every Biſhop has the ſupreme Government of his own Church,<note place="margin">Ne<expan>

Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thag.</note> and his Liberty and Power to chooſe for himſelf, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us; and muſt not be compelled to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by any of his Colleagues, which overthrows the proper Juriſdiction of general Councils, which can have no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Authority over any Biſhops, who refuſe to conſent, unleſs it be in ſuch Matters as concern the purity of Faith and Manners, or Catholick Unity; in other Matters if St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> principle be
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93053:91"/>true, the major Number of Votes in Council cannot make a firm Decree, much leſs can the Votes of three or four hundred Biſhops give Laws to all the Biſhops in the Chriſtian Church, which is a plain Demonſtration, that a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council cannot be the ſupreme Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Regent Head of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since every Biſhop from the Unity of Epiſcopacy, and his obligations to Catholick Communion is bound, as far as he can, to govern his particular Church by the mutual Counſel and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his Colleagues, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that both Provincial and General Councils are of very great uſe, though they have no proper juriſdiction; and whatever Biſhop ſhould wilfully refuſe to obſerve the Decrees and Canons of ſuch Councils, without manifeſt neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for not doing it, would be guilty of ſuch pride and obſtinacy, as would fall very little ſhort of the Guilt of Schiſm, when there is a juſt Reaſon for it; we may ſay with St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Non conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus huic concilio, ſalvo jure unitatis. Aug. de haptiſmo l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>25.</hi>
                  </note> we do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this Council, but yet keep the Peace and Unity of the Church intire, and will not heighten every diſſent into a Schiſm; but where there is no ſuch
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93053:91"/>reaſon, it is no better than Schiſmatical pride and peeviſhneſs for any Biſhop to purſue his own humour, in oppoſition to the Decrees and Conſtitutions of his Colleagues; for the very Conſent and Agreement of Biſhops among themſelves is ſo great a good to the Church of God, that That alone is ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine a good man, when there are not very weighty reaſons againſt it.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> I am ſure, thought it a Matter of mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to manage all the great Affairs of the Church by mutual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,<note place="margin">Et dilectio communis &amp; ratio expoſcit, fratres chariſlimi, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil conſcientiae veſtrae ſubtrahere de his quae apud nos geruntur, ut ſit nobis circa utilitatem eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticae adminiſtrationis commune conſilium. Cyp. ep. <hi>29.</hi>
                  </note> in his Letter to the Presbyters and Deacons at <hi>Rome,</hi> written after the Death of <hi>Fabian,</hi> during the vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that See, he tells them, that both mutual Love and Charity, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the thing required, that he ſhould conceal nothing from them of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of his Church; that ſo they might adviſe and conſult with each other, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the moſt uſeful Rules of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Adminiſtrations. And therefore he tells us, that he put off the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the State of the Lapſed, and would not innovate any thing in the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93053:92"/>ancient Rules of Diſcipline, till God ſhould be pleaſed to reſtore Peace to the Church,<note place="margin">Cypr. ep. 40.</note> that they might meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for common Advice. And the <hi>Roman</hi> Presbyters in anſwer to another Letter of St. <hi>Cyprians,</hi> approve of this reſolution, and add a very weighty Reaſon for it, that it is impoſſible that Decree ſhould be firm, and obtain a general Complyance, which is not made by the Conſent of many:<note place="margin">ep. 31.</note> And therefore I obſerved in the Defence, that though they had no ſuch thing as a general Council, before the times of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> yet they had frequent Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and ſent their Synodical Letters to Forraign Churches, with an account of their Tranſactions and Decrees, that they might either approve them in their Councils, or give them an account of their Diſſent, and the Reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> asks me, whether they ſent theſe Letters all the World over;<note place="margin">Cam quo nobis totus orois com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercio for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matarum in una Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munionis ſocietate concordat Opt. lib. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> and I anſwer, I believe they did not, becauſe I ſuſpect it is not to be done; no more than a general Council can be convened from all parts of the World; but yet it is evident, this Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Letters was ſo general, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi> found the Conſent
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93053:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the whole Church upon it: However half the World, or all the known fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Churches were ſufficient for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Counſel, though not for ſupreme uncontroulable Government, which I never aſſerted; to adviſe with all the known Churches, which were within the reach of ſuch Communication, is ſufficient to ſatisfie us, how neceſſary they thought it, to uſe the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Means they could to preſerve Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion; and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved mutual Advice and Counſel a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper means for that end, and the Duty of all true Catholick Biſhops.</p>
               <p>This way St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls an <hi>Epiſtolare Colloquium,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de baptiſmo. l. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> a Conference by Letters, which he thinks is not to be compared with the <hi>Plenarium Concilium,</hi> as he very properly calls a general Council, a full or plenary Council, which is made up of wiſe and learned Prelates from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant parts of the World. For when the Biſhops of ſo many ſeveral Churches, who may be well preſumed to know the Judgment and Practiſe of their own Churches, meet together without any private or factious Deſigns, freely to debate and conſult for the publick good of the Church, the Authority of ſuch a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93053:93"/>Council muſt needs be venerable, and it muſt be ſome very great reaſon, that will juſtifie a diſſent from it.</p>
               <p>Such Councils indeed are not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">Article 21.</note> as our Church aſſerts, becauſe they conſiſt of fallible men, who may be, and have been deceived; and therefore in Matters neceſſary to Salvation, we muſt believe them no farther, than they agree with the holy Scriptures; though a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt man will not oppoſe his private judgment to the Decrees of a general Council, unleſs the Authority of the Scripture be very expreſly againſt it; but in Rules of Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their Authority is greater ſtill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Canons of general Councils are a great Medium, and excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Catholick Communion, the promoting of which is the principal end and the greateſt uſe of general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; and therefore though they do not command by any direct Authority, and ſuperior Juriſdiction, yet they ſtrongly oblige in order to ſerve the ends of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But now, ſuppoſe a man ſhould aſſert the Authority of a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, how does this ſubvert the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, or incur a Premunire? For
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93053:93"/>let the Authority of a general Council be what it will, it is wholly Spiritual, as the whole Government of the Church is, conſidered meerly as a Church or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Society; but the Supremacy of the King is an external and civil Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in all Cauſes, and over all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Eccleſiaſtical, within his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> might as well ſay, that every man, who ſets up any ſpiritual Authority in the Church, ſubverts the Supremacy of the King; and thus the King's Supremacy makes him a Biſhop and a Prieſt too, a Scandal which Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s Predeceſſors raiſed in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> days, to diſſwade People from the Oath of Supremacy, which it ſeems they were not then ſo fond of, and which the Queen confutes in her Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and tells her Subjects, that <hi>ſhe neither doth, nor ever will, challenge any other Authority,</hi> but only this, <hi>under God to have the Soveraignty and Rule over all manner of Perſons, born within theſe her Realms, Dominions, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, of what Estate, either Eccleſiastical or Temporal ſoever they be, ſo as no other Forraign Power ſhall or ought to have any Superiority over them.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:93053:94"/>
               <p>When Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> writ his Apology and Defence to <hi>Scipio,</hi> a Patrician of <hi>Venice,</hi> who complained of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation for not ſending their Legates to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> he never thought of this reaſon againſt it, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the King's Supremacy, which is owned and confirmed by the Laws of this Land; and we may obſerve that the Statutes of Proviſors, and ſeveral Laws to preſerve the Liberties of the Realm from the Uſurpations of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other Forraign Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, were made and confirmed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kings Reigns, long before <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> a particular Account of which the Reader may find in Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Reformation, part 1. Book 2. p. 107. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon which the Clergy were convicted in a Praemunire by King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> and therefore Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> truly obſerves,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bramhall</hi>'s vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> That the Supremacy was not a new Authority uſurped by that King, but the ancient Right of the Imperial Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and yet in thoſe days it was not deemed a Subverſion of the Supremacy, to acknowledge the Authority of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils. For after the Statutes of Proviſors, we find the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93053:94"/>in the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> which aſſerted the Authority of general Councils as high, as ever any men did.</p>
               <p>For indeed, ſince Princes have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Chriſtian Faith, no Biſhops, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to call a general Council, but by the Will and Authority of the Prince, nor can the Decrees and Canons of any Council be received in any Kingdom, or obtain the Authority of Laws, but by the Conſent of the Prince, which therefore certainly can be no encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his Supremacy: While the King has the ſupreme executive Power in all Cauſes, and over all Perſons in his own Hands, the ſpiritual Power and Authority of the Church is no invaſion of his Rights.</p>
               <p>This is ſufficient at preſent, in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s inſinuation, that to aſſert the Authority of general Councils, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the Kings Supremacy, ſubjects the Church of <hi>England</hi> to a Forraign Court and Juriſdiction, and thereby incurs the Penalty of a Praemunire; whereby we ſee, that he underſtands the Law as little, as he does the Goſpel, only ſhews his good Will to poor <hi>Caſſandrians,</hi> and as much as he declames againſt penal
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93053:95"/>Laws againſt Diſſenters, would be glad to ſee the Church of <hi>England</hi> once more under the Execution of a Praemunire.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> has not done with me yet, but to make me a perfect <hi>Caſſandrian,</hi> whether I will or not, he adds as my ſenſe,<note place="margin">Reply p. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>That this Council of Forraign Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, unto which they</hi> (i.e. the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) <hi>are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, muſt look on the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>as their Primate; the Primacy of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>being acknowledged, it ſeems, by our Author himſelf, as well as by</hi> Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall. <hi>The Primacy (he ſaith) out of</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, <hi>being given to</hi> Peter, <hi>that it might appear, that the Church of Christ was one, and the Chair, that is, the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Office and Power is one. Thus</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, <hi>on whom lay all the Care of the Churches, diſpatches Letters to</hi> Rome, <hi>from whence they were ſent through all the Catholick Churches; all this is to be found from</hi> p. 208. <hi>to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a terrible Charge indeed, and home to the Purpoſe, and Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> is a terrible Adverſary in theſe days, if he can but Swear, as well as he can Write; for all this is Forgery and Villany, as any man may ſatisfie himſelf, who will
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93053:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>be at the Pains to peruſe that part of the Defence, he directs to; where I am ſo far from aſſerting the Primacy of St. <hi>Peter</hi> over all Biſhops, that I do expreſly vindicate that paſſage of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which the Flatterers of the Pope alledge for this Primacy, from ſignifying any ſuch thing; and for the Satisfaction of all indifferent Readers, what Credit is to be given to Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> I will tranſcribe the whole Paſſage, though it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long, as a ſufficient Confutation of this Calumny, and it is this.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And in his (<hi>Cyprian</hi>'s) Book of the Unity of the Church, the firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he uſes to prove the Unity of the Church, is the Unity of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Office (and what that means, I have already ſufficiently explained) and aſſigns this as the reaſon, why our Saviour, in a particular Manner, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Keys to <hi>Peter</hi> (when he gave the ſame Power to all the reſt of the Apoſtles, which he did to <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>viz.</hi> to manifeſt the Unity of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Office and Power, that <hi>there is but one Chair, and one original of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which begins in one; for the rest of the Apoſtles were the ſame, that</hi> Peter <hi>was, had an equal ſhare in the Honour
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93053:96"/>and Power of the Apoſtolical Office; but the beginning is from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and the Primacy is given to</hi> Peter, <hi>that it might appear, that the Church of Christ is one, and the Chair one,</hi> i.e. <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Office and Power; they are all Pastors, but there is but one Flock, which is fed by all the Apoſtles with a joynt Conſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the plain Scope and Deſign of this Paſſage of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (which has been ſo often abuſed, eſpecially by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>) that our Saviour in naming <hi>Peter</hi> only, in giving the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Power, did ſignifie, that the Apoſtolical Office, though exerciſed by ſeveral Perſons, is but one Office and Power, which is not ſo properly divided among the Apoſtles, as admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by a joynt Conſent; and therefore giving this Power to one Apoſtle, included the beſtowing this Power on the whole Apoſtolical Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, when St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays, that Chriſt built his Church upon <hi>Peter,</hi> he does not, and cannot mean, the Perſon of <hi>Peter,</hi> or any thing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to him, but that Apoſtolical Office and Power, which was given
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93053:96"/>to the Colledge of the Apoſtles in the Name of <hi>Peter,</hi> as the Church is ſaid to be built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets. And when he ſays, that Chriſt gave the Primacy to <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet at the ſame time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that the other Apoſtles were equal ſharers with him in Honour and Power, and were all that, which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was, it can ſignifie no more, nor no leſs, than that Chriſt named <hi>Peter</hi> firſt, or rather in ſtead of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, thereby to inſtruct them, that though they were many, yet their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Power was but one, which they muſt exerciſe as one man with one Conſent.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This I ſuppoſe is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſatisfie any man, how far I am from aſcribing to <hi>Peter</hi> a Primacy over all the Apoſtles, much leſs to the Pope over all Biſhops, as <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>And this is all I can find, that either Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> or Mr. <hi>B.</hi> urges to prove me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> deſign; but now for the Contradictions I am charged with.

He defendeth Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet's <hi>denial of any political, conſtitutive, ſupreme Power, and yet maintaineth that the whole Church hath one Regent part, which all muſt obey, that will be Members.</hi> This I confeſs, is a Contradiction, for if the whole Church hath <hi>one Regent Part,</hi> it muſt have a conſtitutive Regent Head. This he ſays, I affirm, but he could not tell where, and therefore never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to cite my words for it. <hi>But</hi> (as he goes on) <hi>he will not grant, that every Political body muſt have a constitutive Regent Head; and yet he doth but ſay (if we deny this) as if he could not, or durſt not tell, what he grants, or denies; yet he grants that</hi> (<hi>every Political body conſiſts of a</hi> Pars Imperans <hi>and</hi> Subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta) <hi>and that Church Governors united and governing by Conſent are the</hi> Pars Imperans, <hi>and Chriſtian People the</hi> Pars Subdita) <hi>but ſaith he (all this is true without a constitutive Regent Head) can you tell how his aſſerted, and his denyed Propoſitions differ?</hi> 1. <hi>It is not a Regent part he denyeth.</hi> 2. <hi>It is not, that this Regent part is one to the whole Body,

For if it were that, he would not ſo zealouſly contradict and condemn us, that ſay the ſame thing as he.</hi> And here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himſelf has unridled this whole Myſtery of Contradictions, though he was not willing to underſtand it, becauſe then he had had nothing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. I deny, that there is one conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Regent Head, either of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, or the Univerſal Church, but yet affirm, that there is a Government in the Church, and conſequently, that there is a governing and a governed Part, that the Biſhops are the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church, and the Chriſtian People, thoſe who are governed; now I thought Mr. <hi>B.</hi> without a new Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary (unleſs it be a Dictionary to teach common ſenſe, which indeed would be the beſt Cure in the World for Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm) might have underſtood, that when I denyed, that there is any one conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Regent Head of the Church, and at the ſame time aſſerted, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are the Regent and governing part of the Church, I could not mean, that the Biſhops were the Governors of the Church, as united into one Common Regent Head over the whole Church, but they were Governors of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93053:98"/>Church, as every Biſhop governed his own ſhare and portion of it, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Charge.</p>
               <p>This was the State of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie between Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and the Dr. Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> will not allow a National Church, to be one political Body and Society, unleſs it have one conſtitutive Regent Head, for he ſays, <hi>many Churches aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for mutual Help and Concord,</hi>

                  <hi>are but in a looſe ſenſe called a Church, not in a political Senſe, but equivocally ſo called; and that the Eccleſiastical Government of the particular Churches ſeverally, makes it no Church, but an aſſociation of many Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Reader will be the better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judge of this Diſpute, if I briefly explain the true Reaſon of all this zeal for <hi>one constitutive Regent Head</hi> of the Church, which I perceive very few Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple underſtand; for indeed it is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery but lately diſcovered by Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and earneſtly eſpouſed by Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry,</hi> to juſtifie all the Schiſms and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the World, and to make all the diſtinct and ſeparate Communions in a Nation, one National Church, and all the ſeparate Churches in the World, one Catholick Church.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:93053:98"/>
               <p>For, 1. they aſſert, that a particular Congregation aſſociated for local pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Communion under a fixed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, is the only Church of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which I have at large confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the 5 and 6 Chapters of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and none of my Adverſaries have been ſo hardy yet, as to attempt the leaſt Reply.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all theſe ſingle Churches all the World over become one Catholick Church, not by any Union among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but by being all united in Chriſt, who is the ſupreme Regent conſtitutive Head of the Catholick Church; there is no need they ſhould be all united to one another, to make one Catholick Church, ſo they be all united to Chriſt, the Head of the Church. Of which I have diſcourſed above in the ſecond Chapter of this Vindication.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It hence follows, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make one National Church upon pure Eccleſiaſtical Principles; for every one of theſe ſingle Churches with their particular Paſtors over them, are origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Churches of Divine Inſtitution, and no one Church or Paſtor, has a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Power and Juriſdiction over the reſt; and therefore though particular
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93053:99"/>Churches may voluntarily aſſociate with each other for mutual Help and Concord, yet this cannot make them one Political organized Body or Church, but only a Church in a looſe equivocal ſenſe; for it is contrary to all the Maxims of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that That ſhould be called one Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Body, which has not one Political conſtitutive Regent Head, that is, one ſuperior Power over the whole Body, either Monarchical, Ariſtocratical, or Democratical; and ſince Chriſt hath given no one Paſtor or Biſhop a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Authority to govern the reſt, which would make the Church a Monarchy, nor united all Paſtors into one govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Head, which ſhould govern the whole Church, and their own Members by a major Vote, which is an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, nor erected a mixt Tribunal of Paſtors and People, which is a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, it is evident, that the ſeveral Churches and Paſtors in a Nation, are not by divine Inſtitution united under any one Eccleſiaſtical governing Head, and therefore cannot be one Political National Church; which makes it a fond thing to cry out of Schiſm and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, from the National Church of <hi>England,</hi> when there is, and can be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93053:99"/>no ſuch thing, in a proper Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And therefore the only Notion of a National Church, is all the Churches of a Nation united under the King, as the accidental Head of the Church, who is the ſupreme Head, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Church in his Dominions. And thus the National Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has no other Foundation, but the Laws of the Land, and the Supremacy of the King; it is the Creature of the ſupreme Power, which made it, and may unmake it again, when it pleaſeth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And therefore the moſt effectual way of uniting all Diſſenters, is not to enjoyn Conformity to any one Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but to give a legal Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the different Sects and Parties among us, at leaſt to all thoſe, which are tolerable, which ſhall be under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the King's Miniſters, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lay or Clergy, in Eccleſiaſtical affairs, and thus all the Diſſenters, which are now among us, as much as they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the preſent Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and from each other, ſhall immediately become the Members of this accidental National
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93053:100"/>Church of <hi>England,</hi> under the King as an accidental Head; and thus the Schiſm, which we ſo much complain of, is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually cured, according to Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry</hi>'s Materials for Union, which ſhall be particularly examined in their due place.</p>
               <p>This is the plain account of this whole Intrigue, and that the impartial Reader may the better judge, where the Diſpute lies between me and my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, I ſhall as plainly repreſent in one view a Scheme of my Principles, upon which I oppoſe this.</p>
               <p>As 1. That Chriſt hath but one Church, which we call the Catholick Church, and is antecedent in order of Nature before particular Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Churches, which are Churches not conſidered as independent Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but as Members of the Catholick Church, which I proved at large in the <hi>3d.</hi> Chapter of the Defence, and the <hi>1ſt.</hi> Chap. of this Vindication.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all the Churches in the World are one Catholick Church, as united in one Catholick Communion; as I have proved in the <hi>4th.</hi> Chapter of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and the <hi>2d.</hi> Chapter of this Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:93053:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="3">3. That the Church is a Society un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Government, has a governing and a governed Part; that the Biſhops are the Governors of the Church, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian People, thoſe who are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That all Biſhops are originally of equal Power, and that every Biſhop is ſupreme in his own Dioceſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That yet all Biſhops and Churches are bound to live in Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with each other, that is, as Members of the ſame great Body, the Catholick Church, and every Biſhop, as far as poſſibly he can, muſt govern his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church and Dioceſs, by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Advice and Conſent of neighbour Biſhops.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That this is the Foundation of thoſe greater Combinations of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, conſidered as Churches, or pure Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Societies, into Archiepiſcopal, Metropolitical, or National Churches, which ſignifies no more than the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Combination of ſuch Biſhops and Churches into a ſtricter Aſſociation, for the better Preſervation of one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, by mutual Advice and Counſel, Concord and Agreement, in Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:93053:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="7">7. That for the preſervation of Peace and Order in this united Body or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation of neighbour Churches, one or more Biſhops may by a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be intruſted with a ſuperior Power of calling Synods, receiving Appeals, and exerciſing ſome peculiar Acts of Diſcipline, under the Regulation of Eccleſiaſtical Canons; which is the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er now aſcribed to Arch-biſhops and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That yet there cannot be one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Eccleſiaſtical Regent Head in a National, much leſs in the Univerſal Church; not Monarchical, becauſe no one Biſhop has an original Right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the reſt in any Nation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever Power may be granted him by Conſent, yet it is not eſſential to the Being or Unity of the Church, which is one, not by being united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one ſuperior governing Power, but by living in one Communion; not Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical, becauſe every Biſhop being ſupreme in his own Dioceſs, and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Chriſt for his Government, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not and ought not ſo wholly to diveſt himſelf of this Power, as to be in all Oa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes neceſſarily determined and over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Major Vote, contrary to his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93053:101"/>own Judgment and Conſcience; he is always bound to live in Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with his Colleagues, while they do not violate the Terms of Catholick Communion; and as far as poſſibly he can, he muſt comply with their Decrees to preſerve Peace and Order; but if they ſhould decree any thing, which he judges prejudicial to his Church, he is bound not to comply with them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the chief Care of his Church is committed to him, and he cannot ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely give away the Government of it to others. From whence it appears, that all the Biſhops in a Nation, much leſs all the Biſhops in the World, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not unite into ſuch a Colledge, as ſhall by a ſupreme Authority, govern all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Churches by a Major Vote, which is the Form of Ariſtocratical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: And for the ſame Reaſon a National Church conſidered as a Church, cannot be under the government of a Democratical Head, for if the Colledge of Biſhops have not this Power, much leſs has a mixt Colledge of Biſhops and People.</p>
               <p>Let any impartial Reader now judge, wherein I contradict my ſelf in this Scheme of Church Government: I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93053:102"/>the Church to be a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Society, to have a <hi>pars Imperans &amp; Subdita;</hi> for every Biſhop is the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his own Church, and thus the whole Church is governed by parts. I deny, that there is any one conſtitutive Regent Head of a National or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church; becauſe every Biſhop is the ſupreme Governor of his Church, and cannot ſo abſolutely part with his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Right to any Biſhop, or Colledge of Biſhops, as to oblige himſelf to govern his Church by their Order and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though contrary to his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conſcience; but yet the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy is one, becauſe all Biſhops have the ſame Power, and are bound to live in the ſame Communion, and to govern their ſeveral Churches by mutual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Conſent; and in order to this, may unite themſelves in ſtricter Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and Confederacies, under ſuch Rules of Government, as do not encroach upon the unalienable Rights and Power of the Epiſcopacy: And this is ſufficient to make them one Church, for if the Catholick Church be one by one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion, why may not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church be one, by one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? And thoſe guilty of Schiſm, who
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93053:102"/>ſeparate without juſt Cauſe from ſuch a National Union of Churches, though it were not backt by any Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or humane Laws?</p>
               <p>And now I doubt not, but every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Reader, will think it needleſs to give a particular Anſwer to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing Objections of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> but I muſt beg his patience (for the ſake of others, who are very unwilling to underſtand theſe Matters) while I particularly apply, what I have now diſcourſed, in Anſwer to them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhamed, that I am forced to prevent ſuch wilful or ignorant Miſtakes, by ſo frequent a Repetition of the ſame things; but I conſider, it is better to do this effectually once, than to be obliged to write, as often as theſe men can ſpit Books.</p>
               <p>The original Diſpute was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the constitutive Regent Head of the Church of</hi> England; in Anſwer to which Queſtion, who is the conſtitutive Regent Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I 1. diſtinguiſhed between a National Church, conſidered as a Church, and as incorporated into the State, and 2. reinforced the Deans Anſwer to this Queſtion; and though I know not any
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93053:103"/>one thing, that need be added to what I have already Diſcourſed in the <hi>7th.</hi> Chapter of the Defence, yet this being the Chief, and almoſt only Place my Adverſaries have thought fit to fix on, to ſhew their great Abilities, I ſhall briefly review this Diſpute in the ſame Method, which I before obſerved, that I may not confound my Readers with altering the ſtate of the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I distinguiſh between a National Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defence, p. 558.</note> 
                  <hi>conſidered as a Church, and as a Church incorporated with the State;</hi> this Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays, <hi>is no good distinction, becauſe the Church is National only under the last Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,</hi> i. e. as incorporated with the State.<note place="margin">Reply, p. 130.</note> 
                  <hi>The Church of Chriſt conſidered in its ſelf, is either <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal or Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but it muſt be conſidered as incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the State, to make it National.</hi> Now this is ſaid without any Reaſon, and therefore might be as well denyed, without aſſigning any Reaſon for ſuch a Denyal; but to ſatisfie Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in this Point, I anſwer.</p>
               <p>That the Church, conſidered as a Church, is not neceſſarily conſidered, either as Univerſal or Particular. The eſſential Notion of a Chriſtian Church, is a Body or Society of men confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93053:103"/>in the Faith, and for the Worſhip of Chriſt under ſuch Church Officers, as he hath appointed: That this Church is Univerſal, is founded on the Laws of Catholick Communion, which unites all particular Societies of Chriſtians into one Body; that it is divided into particular Churches, is owing to the Neceſſity of things, for ſince all Chriſtians in remote and diſtant places of the World, cannot all worſhip God together, nor live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Care and Government of one Biſhop, this makes it neceſſary, that the Epiſcopal Office and Power be divided into many hands, and the Multitude of Chriſtians divided into many particular Churches, under their proper Paſtors, but in the ſame Communion.</p>
               <p>Now if Catholick Communion makes all the Churches in the World, one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Catholick Church, and a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Communion, makes a particular Church, why does not a National Church-Communion make one National Church? A Church is a Church, conſidered as a Religious Body and Society of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as I have now deſcribed it, but it is Univerſal, National, or Particular, from the different degrees and kinds of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and therefore Churches joyned
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93053:104"/>in National Communion are properly called a National Church, though there were no Chriſtian Prince to head it.</p>
               <p>And that a National Church is of a diſtinct Conſideration, as it is a Church, and as incorporated with the State, I proved in the Defence from this Topick, that <hi>de facto,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 558.</note> 
                  <hi>there have been, and may be still, National Churches, when the Prince and great numbers of the People are not Chriſtians. For Patriarchal and Metropolitan combinations of Churches, are of the ſame Nature with what we call National Churches, and ſuch there were in the times of</hi> Paganiſm <hi>under Heathen and perſecuting Emperors.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>A Patriarchal Church, and a Metropolitan Church, is not a Church National. A Patriarchate may contain in it the Churches of many Nations; A Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan but half the Chriſtians of one, and ſo the one is too bigg, and the other too little to be a National Church, and a Dioceſan much leſs:</hi> But what is this to the Purpoſe? Can Mr. <hi>H.</hi> prove, that a Patriarchate muſt of neceſſity be always larger, and a Metropolitan Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways leſs than a Nation? Might not a National Synod before the Converſion of Princes to the Chriſtian Faith have
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93053:104"/>ſet up a Patriarch, or Metropolitan over themſelves? and may not the Kings of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> do ſo ſtill, if they pleaſe? And yet I did not ſay, that a Patriarchal or Metropolitan Church, was a National Church, but of the ſame Nature with a National Church, that is, they were a voluntary Combination of Churches, founded on the Laws of Catholick Communion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to any civil Conjunction, by the Laws and Authority of Princes; and I would fain know any Reaſon, why all the Chriſtian Churches in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may not thus unite, and why Churches thus united, may not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a National Church, though they were not Confirmed and Eſtabliſht by humane Laws; though the Prince, and great part of his Subjects, were Infidels, Hereticks or Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> obſerves, that I ſay,<note place="margin">Reply, p. 131.</note> 
                  <hi>I cannot tell, why it is accidental to the Church of Chriſt to be National, any more than to be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, or Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal and Metropolitical, any more than <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> and Anſwers, <hi>But when I tell him, that the Body of Chriſt (which is his Church) may ſubſiſt, though there were never a Patriarch, or Metropolitan in the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93053:105"/>Earth; I hope, he can ſee (if he will) how the Conſederation of the Church, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal or Metropolitical, and ſo Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, muſt be accidental to it.</hi> I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing to ſee any thing, I can; but I can ſee nothing here, but his Miſtake. That the Church cannot ſubſiſt without a Patriarch or Metropolitan, I never ſaid yet, nor does he produce any place, where I have ſaid it, for what he ſays, are not my words, but his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All that I ſay is this, that the Aſſociation and Confederacy of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches is founded on the Law of Catholick Communion, and that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion cannot be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without it; that ſuch Combinations of Churches in ſeveral Nations and Provinces there were, long before there were any Chriſtian Princes, and may be ſo ſtill, though there were no Chriſtian Kings in the World, and therefore that a Church may be National, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incorporated into the State.</p>
               <p>It is true, ſince the firſt Records of Church-Hiſtory, theſe greater Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Churches, have by mutual Conſent had a Patriarch, Primate, or Metropolitan ſet over them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot ſpeak of theſe Churches
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93053:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the Ancient Language, without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them Patriarchal or Metropolitical Churches; but my Argument does not proceed upon the Union of Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Patriarch or Metropolitan, but upon their Aſſociation for Advice and Councel, and Diſcipline, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Catholick Communion.</p>
               <p>There may be ſuch Aſſociations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Patriarch or Metropolitan; but the univerſal Church has always thought it moſt convenient to have one; and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is greatly miſtaken to think, that every thing, which is not eſſential to a Church, is accidental. There are a great many prudential Conſtitutions in Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are of great uſe to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of a Society, though not of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity to its being; and he would be thought a very mean Politician, who ſhould call the Reſults of the beſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſideration, and moſt mature advice for the publick Good, accidental Conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>The Union of neighbour Churches for Worſhip, Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not accidental to the Church, but the neceſſary Reſult of Catholick Communion, which is a binding Law to all Churches, and hereon I found a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93053:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>Church; The Superiority and Juriſdiction of Patriarchs or Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, is not eſſential to the Church, but a preſent Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, which ought not to be called Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, unleſs when they are the Reſults of Chance, or the Effects of Folly, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Raſhneſs, like Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental National Church, patcht up of forty ſeparate Communions, united in an accidental Head; but this man, I perceive, is an <hi>Epicurean</hi> Divine, who makes the Church, as that Philoſopher did the World, by a fortuitous jumble of Atoms.</p>
               <p>But at laſt, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> grants me all that I ask, with reference to National Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; for to prove, <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of all the Christian Churches in a Nation into one Body and Society, is no more an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Conſideration of the Church, than the univerſal Church it ſelf is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defence, p. 561.</note> I obſerved, That <hi>our Saviour gave Command to his Apostles to go teach all Nations, and to plant Churches in them, and therefore this was the Intention of our Saviour, that there ſhould be Churches in all Nations, as well as in all the World; and if all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the World muſt make but one Church, then certainly much more muſt all the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93053:106"/>Churches in a Nation be but one; which are in a nearer Capacity of Communion with each other, than the Churches of all the World are, and whereby Catholick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Communion may be more eaſily preſerved, than if all the Churches in a Nation were ſingle and independent; there being a more eaſie correſpondence between Nations, than between every Town and City in diſtant Nations.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>H.</hi> replies.<note place="margin">Reply, p. 131.</note> 
                  <hi>And as for Chriſts Command of planting Churches in the whole World, and ſo in Nations, and Cities and Towns, requiring <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Communion every where among Chriſtians</hi> (i. e. the Unity and Communion of one Body, for that is my meaning) <hi>it may warrant the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of Patriarchal, Metropolitical, National, Dioceſan, and Parochial Churches to this end</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> to maintain one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion) <hi>if he pleaſe, provided only, that theſe Forms be held only acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Forms, according to humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and not the Eſſential Form of the Church of Chriſt, according to divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi> But we are not a talking of Church-forms, but of Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The Patriarchal or Metropoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church-form is an Eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, though not therefore acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93053:107"/>as I obſerved before; but Catholick Communion is a divine Inſtitution, and therefore the Combinations of Churches for Catholick Communion is divine alſo,<note place="margin">See the Defence, p. 258.</note> though the particular Forms of ſuch Combinations may be regulated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Eccleſiaſtical Prudence, which differs ſomewhat from what we call meer humane Prudence, becauſe it is not the Reſult of meer natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but founded on, and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a divine Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Now if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will, as we ſee at laſt he does, own ſuch Combinations of Churches into one Body for Catholick Communion, according to our Saviours, that is, a divine Inſtitution, then we find a National Church antecedent to any humane Laws, and of a diſtinct Conſideration from a Church incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the State. But after all, I wonder what Church-form Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will own to be of divine Inſtitution, ſince he ſays, that <hi>Patriarchal, Metropolitical, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, Dioceſan, and Parochial Churches, must be held only accidental forms accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to humane prudence,</hi> there is no form left, that I know of, but an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Church-form, to be of divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will own this,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93053:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>farewell to Catholick Communion, for Independency in the very Nature of it, is a Schiſm, as I have proved in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>There is one thing more Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays, which, becauſe it is very pleaſant, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the laſt.<note place="margin">Reply, p. 130.</note> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> proves a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, to be an accidental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of a Church, becauſe, that to the being of a National Church it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that all the People of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be Chriſtians, and that the King ſhould be ſo alſo, both which are very accidental things, and therefore a National Church is an accidental Church, now I proved in the Defence, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe was neceſſary to make a Church National; and all the Anſwer he gives to it, is this; <hi>When we ſpeak of a National Church, our own is always to be underſtood, about which the Diſpute is and our Church is a National Political Church, no otherwiſe but upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> (that is, that the People and the Prince are Chriſtians) <hi>and the Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof is neceſſary to it.</hi> And a little after he tells us, <hi>By a National Church we commonly underſtand (I apprehend) a Political Church, wherein all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Christians and Churches in a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93053:108"/>and thoſe only, are combined under the Government, through the ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, to Church-purpoſes.</hi> This is ſuch a looſe deſcription of a National Church, as may ſerve almoſt any purpoſe; But the whole force of his Reaſoning is this, that the National Church of <hi>England</hi> (and ſo other National Churches under Chriſtian Princes) is incorporated into the State, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is a National Church, only as it is incorporated into the State, and the Suppoſition of this is neceſſary to make it a National Church; the laſt Reſult of which, is no more but this, <hi>Bellarmine thou lieſt.</hi> I had aſſerted and proved, that a National Church may be conſidered as a Church, and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into the State, in Anſwer to this; Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a National Church, only as it is incorporated into the State, which is the thing he ought to have proved, but he thought it more convenient only to affirm it; how eaſie is it to anſwer Books, if bold denyals, or bold and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Aſſertions may paſs for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer?</p>
               <p>Or does Mr. <hi>H.</hi> indeed think, that becauſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and eſtabliſhed by Civil Laws,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93053:108"/>and Sanctions, and humane Authority, therefore it can be conſidered as a Church upon no other account? May not the ſame thing be conſidered under different Reſpects and Relations? Or does he think with Mr. <hi>Hobb</hi>'s, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity it ſelf can be a Law to us, only conſidered as the Law of the Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is now made the Law of the Land? And if Chriſtian Religion as the Law and Inſtitution of Chriſt, be of a diſtinct Conſideration from its being the Law of the Land, ſo muſt the Chriſtian Church be too, the Inſtitution of which is a great part of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Sacraments and Promiſes, the Remiſſion of ſins, and eternal Life being confined to the Communion of the Church; and the Laws of Princes can as well make a new Chriſtian Religion, as a new Chriſtian Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a National Church muſt be diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered as a Church, and as incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into the State, for no Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can make that to be a Church, which is not a Church, nor that to be one National Church, which is not one National Communion, one Communion being neceſſary to make any Church one, whether it be the Univerſal, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93053:109"/>or particular Church. But of this more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Having thus vindicated a National Church, and proved it to be a Church, before and after its incorporation into the State, the next inquiry is, whether a National Church be a Political Body or Society, now this Diſpute will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be at an end, if we do but recover the true State of the Controverſie: Mr. <hi>B.</hi> asked, what is the conſtitutive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Head of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> the Dean denyed, that there is any ſuch Head of the Church of <hi>England</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a Church, though the King be the ſupreme Head and Governor of the Church, as it is incorporated into the State: Mr. <hi>B.</hi> replyes, that the Church muſt have ſuch a conſtitutive Regent Head, becauſe every political Society muſt have one conſtitutive Regent Head, or elſe it is not one Politie: to this I anſwered in the Defence of the Dean, that if the Church cannot be a Political Society without one conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Regent Head, then the Church is not a Political Society, for it neither have nor can have any ſuch conſtitutive Regent Head on earth over the whole. That the Church is one, not by one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93053:109"/>Power over the whole, <hi>an inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſpecifying, unifying, ſupreme Power,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls it, but by one Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his Anſwer to me,<note place="margin">p. 184.</note> inſtead of proving that the Church is ſuch a Political Society, as has one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Regent Head, he produces his <hi>Definition of</hi> Politica, <hi>and obſerves, that Politie is either a Civil or Eccleſiastical Commonwealth. That</hi> Hooker <hi>and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others entitle their Books of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Politie,</hi> and Spalatenſis<hi>'s learned Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns are</hi> de Republica Eccleſiaſtica. But what is this to the purpoſe? Does <hi>Hooker</hi> ſet up one conſtitutive Regent Head over the Church? Do any of them prove, that Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is the ſame thing? Do not the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Eccleſiaſtical Common-wealth differ as much, as the Church and the State? And therefore he muſt ſtill prove, that as one ſupreme Regent Head is neceſſary to the Unity of a State or Kingdom, ſo it is to the Unity of the Church; which will be a fair Advance towards Popery. And yet I find nothing like a Proof of this, but a down right Affirmation without any Proof, <hi>That the Regent part, is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93053:110"/>part; if it have not one Regent part, it is not one Society, as Political: If it have none, it is no Politie; if it have many, it is many.</hi> This I grant is true of ſuch Societies, as are one by one ſupreme unifying Power; but it is not true of ſuch a Society, as is one, not by one ſupreme Power over the Whole, but by one Communion: And ſuch a Society the Church is, as I largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Defence, and therefore the Church muſt be excepted from Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Rules and Definitions of Politie.</p>
               <p>In another place Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſuſpects,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 203.</note> that the Reaſon of my Oppoſition to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Regent Head, is, that I do not underſtand the Terms, and therefore he takes pains to inſtruct me, what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Head ſignifies, and what Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive ſignifies. But he has as ill luck at gueſſing, as he has at reaſoning: For the quite contrary is true; I did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Terms, but did not like the Thing, and therefore oppoſed it.</p>
               <p>But do I not know, <hi>That Head is commonly taken for</hi> Synonimal <hi>with</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma poteſtas, or the ſupreme Power? Yes I do, and deny that there is ſuch a viſible Regent Head over a National Church, conſidered as a Church.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:93053:110"/>
               <p>Or do I not know, <hi>That a constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Cauſe, in the common Sence of</hi> Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, <hi>ſignifieth the eſſentiating Cauſe, as distinct from the efficient and final.</hi> Yes, I know this too well: <hi>A Political Society either hath Matter and Form, or not. If yea, what is the Form, if not the Regent part in relation to the Body? Its ſpecies is the ſpecifying Form,</hi> quae dat eſſe &amp; nomen, <hi>and in existence it is the unify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or individuating Form. But if it have no Form, it is nothing, and hath no name.</hi> This is a formidable man at Metaphyſicks and Logick, and I do not wonder, he was ſo often too hard for St. <hi>Matthew Hales,</hi> (as he himſelf tells us, in his late additional remarks on the Life of that excellent Perſon, whoſe Name and Memory is Martyred by ſuch Hiſtorians) for I think, few men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding can deal with him.</p>
               <p>But the plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> of all theſe hard words, and Metaphyſical ſubtilty, is no more but this. That in every Society there is ſomething, which makes it ſuch a kind of Society, which in alluſion to Natural beings, he calls the Form of it. That a Political Body being a Society under one ſupreme Government, the ſupreme Power muſt be the Form of it,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93053:111"/>and therefore the National Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Political Society, conſidered as a Church, muſt have a ſupreme conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Regent Head, as the Form of it. The reſult of which reaſoning is this, that if the Church be ſuch a Political Society, as has a ſupreme Regent Head on Earth (which I always denyed) then it muſt have a ſupreme Regent Head. Which if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls Diſputing and Proving, I ſuppoſe no body elſe will: But this will be better underſtood, by conſidering Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Reaſons, to prove this ſupreme Regent Power to be the conſtitutive Form of the Church; which follow in the ſame place, and are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If the</hi> ſumma Poteſtas <hi>of the Church be not the constitutive Form, then the Church is not a Society univocally ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as all other Political Societies are, but is Equivocally called a Politie.</hi> i. e. then the Church is not a Political Society, with one conſtitutive Regent Head, which I readily grant, and ſee no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience in it. Though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly ſuppoſes in his Argument, what he knows I denyed him; that there is ſuch a <hi>ſumma Poteſtas,</hi> or ſupreme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Power over the whole Church, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93053:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>then indeed it were abſurd to deny a conſtitutive Regent Head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Then a Biſhop is no constitutive part of a Dioceſan Church, nor a Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan of a Metropolitan Church, nor a Patriarch of a Patriarchal Church, nor any</hi> ſumma Poteſtas <hi>of any Church: or elſe the Catholick, and theſe are not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally called Churches.</hi> The Force of which reaſoning is this; that if there be not a ſupreme Regent Head over the whole Church, there cannot be ſuch a ſuperior Governor over any part of the Church. A Biſhop cannot govern his own Church, unleſs one Biſhop, or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Biſhops be a ſupreme conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Regent Head over the whole Church: For as for Metropolitans and Patriarchs, I never owned their original Right to ſuch a Superiority, but aſcribe it to Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions, which are very juſtifiable, and of great uſe to the Preſervation of Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: And I do not ſee, what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience there is in granting, that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and the Catholick Church, are not univocally called Churches, that is, are not in the ſame ſenſe called a Church, any more than in ſaying, that a Part, and the Whole, are not in the ſame
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93053:112"/>ſenſe called the Body of a man, for the Whole contains all the Parts, and a Part is only a Part of the Whole: All the particular Churches in the World, are univocally called Churches, as being under the Government of their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Paſtors, in obedience to the Laws and Inſtitutions of our Saviour, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly univerſal Biſhop of his Church, but the Catholick Church is called a Church, from the Union of all particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, not only to Chriſt, the ſupreme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Head of the Church, but to each other in one Catholick Communion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If the</hi> ſumma Poteſtas, <hi>be not a constitutive part of the Church Catholick, it is no eſſential Part;</hi> unleſs by this <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Poteſtas</hi> over the whole Church, he means Chriſt (which alters the ſtate of the Queſtion, of which more preſently) it is ſo far from being an eſſential part of the Church Catholick, that it is no part at all; there being no ſuch ſupreme Power over the whole Church: But, <hi>if ſo, the Church muſt be defined without it; and why do they not give us ſuch a Definition, and tell us, what is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive Form of it, if this be not?</hi> None ſo blind, as thoſe who will not ſee. How often have I told him, what
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93053:112"/>it is, which makes the Catholick Church one Catholick Church, which is the conſtitutive Form he enquires after, <hi>viz.</hi> not one Superior Power over the whole Church, but one Communion?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And then he that denyeth this</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Poteſtas, <hi>and ſeparateth from it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth or ſeparateth from nothing eſſential to the Church;</hi> very right! <hi>Why then do they make obedience eſſential to a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?</hi> Obedience to what? To one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Regent Head over the Church. Who are they that make ſuch obedience neceſſary to a Member? Or may not every Chriſtian be bound to obey his ſpiritual Guides, and Paſtors, unleſs there be one ſupreme Regent Head over the Catholick Church? Now whatever <hi>Lawyers, and men acquainted with the common Terms of Law and Politicks,</hi> to whom Mr. <hi>B.</hi> appeals, may think of ſuch Diſputes, as theſe; I am confident be they what they will, if they be men of ſenſe, they will pity the drudgery of anſwering ſuch trifling Cavils. Though I am glad to hear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> own it as a thing beyond Diſpute, that <hi>a King is the conſtitutive Head,</hi> that is, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Regent Head of his Kingdom, without whoſe ſupreme Government it is not a Kingdom.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:93053:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> proceeds. <hi>But ſaith this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, Its original constitution differs from ſecular Forms of Government, by that ancient Church-canon of our Saviours own decreeing, it ſhall not be ſo among you,</hi> which I alleadged to prove, that the Church could not be a Political So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s notion of it, with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme conſtitutive Regent Power over the whole: To which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> anſwers, <hi>There is ſome hope in this Citation. It ſeems he thinks, that by theſe words Chriſt forbad any conſtitutive Supreme under him in his Church.</hi> Yes verily I do think ſo. <hi>Why then does the man ſo fiercely diſpute for it,</hi> againſt it he means ſurely, for that I have profeſſedly done, but never diſputed for it yet. <hi>If there be none, we are agreed:</hi> In good time; why then does he and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſo rudely ſcorn and deride the Dean, as one who has betrayed the Church, by denying the neceſſity of a conſtitutive Regent Head? I may be a young Doctor, as he pleaſantly adds, but I perceive he grows ſo old, that forgets what he is for or againſt.</p>
               <p>But he is unwilling this ſhould be my meaning, becauſe this ſpoils his Notion of a Political body; and therefore ſpitefully inſinuates what he ſays he will
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93053:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>not impute to me, that I ſpeak of a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie that hath the Power of the Sword;</hi> and yet immediately after this Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he pawns his own underſtanding for it, that I muſt mean ſo. <hi>I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather conclude, that if he know what he ſaith, I am uncapable of knowing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than impute this to him; or elſe that he takes it to be no Policy, that hath not the Power of the Sword:</hi> Let the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie reſt there then, and we will leave it to wiſer men to judge between us.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> do not agree about that Citation, <hi>It ſhall not be ſo among you.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks it a hopeful Citation, and is agreed with me about it. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſayes, none <hi>but ſuch a forward one,</hi> would have alleadged it to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, let them now agree this Matter between themſelves.</p>
               <p>For now I ſhall leave Mr. <hi>B.</hi> a while to hear what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays to the main Diſpute. He undertook in Anſwer to the Dean, to produce an Argument for the Proof of a conſtitutive Regent Head of the Church, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was ſo ſubtil, as to prove only by a Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His Argument was this. <hi>There is a Government in the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.—<hi>Where there is a Government,</hi>

                  <hi>there muſt be a Political Society; every Political Body conſists of a</hi> Pars Regens &amp; ſubdita, — <hi>If the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>then be a Political Church, it muſt have a Regent part, and this conſtitutive Regent part muſt be aſſigned.</hi> To this I anſwered,<note place="margin">Defence, p. 565.</note> by acknowledging that there is a Government in the Church conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a Church; and if all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made a Political Society, then a National Church may be owned to be a Political Society; <hi>for Government by conſent without ſuperiority, is Government: That Church Governors united and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by conſent, are the</hi> pars Imperans; <hi>Chriſtian People in obedience to the Laws of our Saviour, ſubmitting to ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are the</hi> pars Subdita, <hi>and all this is true without a constitutive Regent Head.</hi> The plain meaning of which is this. That there is a Government in the Church, as every Biſhop is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of his own Church, which is but one Government, becauſe all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are bound by the Laws of our Saviour to govern their particular Churches by mutual Advice and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and one Conſent, as far as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the ends of Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and this may be done without

                  <hi>That a National Church is a Political Society?</hi> Yes, I do aſſert, <hi>that if Government</hi> (as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from one conſtitutive Regent Head) <hi>makes a Political Society, then the Church,</hi> (which is a governed Society) <hi>is a Political Society, for Government by conſent without Superiority</hi> (i. e. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one ſupreme Regent Head) <hi>is Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> But <hi>if I grant a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by conſent, underſtanding by it the Epiſcopal Colledge, or</hi> Cyprians <hi>one Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, as the governing Part, and the People by the Law of Chriſt ſubdite to it, then I have found out a conſtitutive Head, and an Eccleſiastical constitutive Head by Christs inſtitution:</hi> For <hi>an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Colledge of Biſhops for Government</hi> (gratia Regiminis) <hi>is a formal Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Head.</hi> I need give no new An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, having already ſufficiently
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93053:115"/>explained, what is meant by St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s one Epiſcopacy, and the Colledge of Biſhops, which is far enough from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an Eccleſiaſtical conſtitutive Regent Head of the Church.</p>
               <p>But to return to Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Sherl.</hi> p. 205.</note> he makes great ſport with that Propoſition, that <hi>Government by conſent without ſuperiority over the</hi> pars Subdita, or over the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who muſt be ſubject to this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>it is governing</hi> ſine jure regendi. <hi>But then I hope we break not the 5th.

It were well indeed for him, that Biſhops had no Authority to govern; for then, as he well obſerves, they might be Schiſmaticks without ſin.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> did not think this anſwer would ſatisfie any man, though he knew the ſpite of it would greatly entertain a true Fanatick Zeal: And therefore he adds. <hi>But I rather think the Doctor meant without ſuperiority over one another.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93053:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>Anſ. And verily doth the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>think, that an Ariſtocracy is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Head, or</hi> ſumma Poteſtas, <hi>or form of Policy? Had the Senators at</hi> Rome <hi>Power over one another, as ſuch? Or hath the</hi> Venetian <hi>Senate, Or the</hi> Polonian <hi>Parliament men? Doth this novelty and ſingularity deſerve no word of Proof, but</hi> ipſe dixit? <hi>See how all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks are damned with the non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, for making Ariſtocracy a Species of Policy. But I pray you, uſe them not all for it as hardly, as you uſe us. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thus much of the World is govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I ſee, (as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays) is a man, who underſtands <hi>Politicks,</hi> and I dare not pretend to ſo much skill in the <hi>Roman, Venetian,</hi> or <hi>Polonian</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but this I think, I can ſafely ſay, as little as I know of them, that the Colledg of Biſhops is neither one nor t'other, nor any kind of Ariſtocracy; for when I ſpeak of a Government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuperiority (that is, without a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme conſtitutive Regent Head, which was the Subject of the Diſpute) it is as wild to imagine, that I mean an Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy, which is ſuch a Regent Head, as that, <hi>by without ſuperiority,</hi> I mean,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93053:116"/>
                  <hi>governing without ſuperiority over the</hi> pars Subdita. But we muſt leave Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to his own way; who thinks he has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his Adverſary ſufficiently, when by a perverſe Comment, he has made him ſpeak or write non-ſence; which muſt be acknowledged the beſt way of confuting Books, when he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the true and genuine ſenſe of them.</p>
               <p>But as to the thing; when I ſay there is a Government in the Church without ſuperiority, or without a conſtitutive Regent Head, the plain meaning is this. That every Biſhop is the chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his own Church, and thus the whole Church is a governed Society, as every particular Church is under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of its own Paſtor; no Biſhops, either ſingle or united, having any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Authority or Superiority over each other. Now though in Ariſtocracy, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual Patrician and Senator have equal Power, yet the Government is not in any of theſe diſtinct, but in the whole Senate, whether that ſignifie the Majority of Voices, or the unanimous Vote of every Member of it, and this makes it properly a Regent Head. But to help Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to underſtand this; if Pride and Intereſt will give him leave,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93053:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>I ſhall particularly conſider the difference between Ariſtocracy, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church by Biſhops, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Regent Head.</p>
               <p>Every Biſhop is the ſupreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his own Church, but no Senator, meerly as a Senator, hath any immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Right, much leſs the ſupreme Right of Government in any diſtinct part of the Nation. For the Government of the Whole is in the Senate, who appoint ſubordinate Governors, either ſome of their own Members, or others; in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on themſelves, who act not by their own, but by the Authority of the Senate.</p>
               <p>Every Biſhop may govern his own Church by his own prudence, has his <hi>Arbitrium proprium,</hi> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks; may regulate publick Worſhip, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Rules of Diſcipline for his own Church, without depending on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any other Biſhop, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of Biſhops, nor is accountable to any, while he preſerves the Purity of Faith and Worſhip, the Unity of the Church, and Catholick Communion, but no ſingle Senator in an Ariſtocracy has any Power of making Laws himſelf, but only in conjunction with others.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:93053:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The Combinations of Churches, and the Synods and Councils of Biſhops are not for direct acts of Government and Superiority over each other, but for the preſervation of Catholick Communion, which is moſt effectually done by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Advice and Counſel, which I think differs a little from the Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of an Ariſtocracy.</p>
               <p>When Neighbour Biſhops thus unite into one Body, and agree upon ſome common rules of Worſhip or Diſcipline, they govern indeed every one their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches by common Advice and Conſent, but ſtill by their own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Authority: They do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Authority from the Synod to govern their Churches, but only agree among themſelves upon ſome common rules of Government, and therefore the Synod is not a Regent Head, becauſe it gives no new Authority; which is quite contrary in an Ariſtocracy, which is the Fountain of all Power for the Government of ſuch a Nation: Which ſhews, how well skilled Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, who thinks,<note place="margin">Reply, p. 134.</note> that <hi>if the Biſhops rule by a Superiority over the People, that makes it an Ariſtocratical Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:93053:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>And this may ſatisfie Mr. <hi>B.</hi> what I mean by a Government by <hi>Conſent</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Superiority, or a Regent Head: Which he turns alſo into Ridicule: <hi>It is not a conſtitutive Supremacy, but a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy by conſent:</hi> No Sir, it is no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy at all; but every Biſhop go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns his own Dioceſs by his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but with the Advice and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of a Synod, or Council, or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Biſhops: A conſent I ſay, not as to the Power of governing, but as to the Rules of Government. And therefore I am not concerned to Diſpute with him, how far <hi>Conſent</hi> is neceſſary to all Government: I ſhall only obſerve, how Mr. <hi>H.</hi> miſtakes both the Dean and me, in what we ſpeak about <hi>Conſent: The Doctor</hi> (he ſays) <hi>holds that Conſent is ſufficient to the making a National Church, underſtanding by Conſent, a Conſent to be of it: The Deans Defender holds the Church to be a Government by Conſent, meaning by it the Conſent of the Biſhops; theſe are two contrary things, the one mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church not Political, and the other makes it an Ariſtocracy:</hi> But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is neither ſo, nor ſo, but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> underſtands neither, as appears from what I have already Diſcourſed: There
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93053:118"/>is no other Conſent required to become a Member of the National Church, then there is to be a Member of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, that is, a Conſent to be a Chriſtian; for every Chriſtian is bound to live in Catholick Communion, as a Member of the one body of Chriſt: And if Catholick Communion makes all the Churches in the World one Catholick Church, it makes all the Churches in a Nation one National Church: But that ſtricter Combination of Churches in the ſame Nation under a Patriarch, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan, or National Synods is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church Government by conſent, as I have already explained it, which is highly uſeful to preſerve Peace and Communion between neighbour-Churches, whoſe neighbourhood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a more cloſe and intimate Union, than there can be between Churches of different Nations, under different Princes, and at a greater diſtance.</p>
               <p>There is but one thing more remains to be conſidered, and ſo I will put an end to this Chapter, and ſquabling Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. And that is to vindicate the Deans Argument againſt the neceſſity of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. conſtitutive Regent Head of the National Church, which in ſhort
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93053:119"/>was this. <hi>If every Church muſt have a conſtitutive Regent Part as eſſential to it, then it unavoidably follows, that there must be a Catholick viſible Head to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick viſible Church, and ſo</hi> Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Regent part of a Church hath done the</hi> Pope <hi>a wonderful kindneſs, and made a very plauſible Plea for his univerſal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorſhip.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> indeed ſays, that the univerſal Church is <hi>headed by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> but as the Dean adds, <hi>this doth not remove the difficulty; for the Question is about that viſible Church, whereof the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches are parts; and they being viſible parts, do require a viſible conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Regent Head, as eſſential to them; therefore the whole viſible Church muſt have likewiſe a viſible constitutive Regent part,</hi> i. e. <hi>a viſible Head of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> anſwered to the Deans Argument, I conſidered and anſwered in the Defence, and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thought fit to let this Diſpute fall; but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> who has not diſcretion enough to know when he is anſwered, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try one trick more with it, and ſee what Logick will do: And he ſays, he has diſcovered <hi>four Terms in the Deans Argument,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reply, p. 135.</note> and if ſo, I promiſe you, it is a very material diſcovery, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93053:119"/>muſt be falſe and fallacious, nay, it ſeems, I have done worſe than the Dean, and have put in a 5th. Term, this is foul play I confeſs, but let us hear, how it is. <hi>I will tell them both plainly</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>H.</hi> who is indeed a very plain Writer) <hi>the Doctor may be aſhamed to put in a fourth Term into his Argument, and this man truly takes the ſhame on him by bringing in a fifth alſo.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 137.</note> 
                  <hi>That which Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>ſaid, was this. That every proper Political Church must have a conſtitutive Head, and the Doctor both leaves out the words proper Political, and brings in the term Viſible; Therefore the Catholick Church</hi> (ſays he) <hi>must have a conſtitutive viſible Head. The Interpoſer now to take off the ſhame from the Doctor, hath taken the right Courſe (I ſay) for he comes and does worſe, and that is, puts in a fifth term into the Argument; if every Church (when he ſhould ſay, every proper Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church only, if he ſpeaks to Mr.</hi> Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>muſt have a viſible ſubordinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive Head, then must the Catholick Church have ſuch a one; but that not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch a one, a National Church, as well as the Catholick, may be without a conſtitutive Head.</hi> I was in a horrible fright, when I heard four and five terms,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93053:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>and began to bluſh at it; but if this be all the Buſineſs, I ſhall be able to bear this ſhame very well.</p>
               <p>As for the Deans leaving out the terms <hi>proper Political,</hi> I gave a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able account of that in the Defence, which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> takes no notice of: For Mr. <hi>B.</hi> defines a proper Political Church to be a Church, which has one conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Regent Head, and therefore the Dean denies, that a National Church is a proper Political Church, conſidered as a Church, in Mr. <hi>B's</hi> ſence of the Words, and this certainly was reaſon enough to leave it out, and yet to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie Mr. <hi>H.</hi> we will take it in, if he will but allow the Catholick Church to be as <hi>proper Political</hi> a Church, as the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church is; and then the Argument runs thus. <hi>If a National Church, as a proper Political Church, muſt have a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conſtitutive Regent Head, as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to it; then the Catholick Church as a proper Political Church, must have a Catholick viſible Regent Head eſſential to it.</hi> And thus I think it comes much to one, and let Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> take their choice.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall we do with the Deans fourth term the <hi>viſible Head,</hi> time was,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93053:120"/>when Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> thought this no inconvenience at all, nor any ſurrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious fourth term crept into the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but learnedly diſputed, that Chriſt is the viſible Head of the Catholick Church; and therefore the Catholick Church hath a viſible Head, as well as the National Church. But let us briefly conſider, whether <hi>viſible</hi> be a fourth Term, or only added as a neceſſary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Propoſition, if he mean any thing by it: For I think <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> diſtinguiſh between a fourth Term, and an additional explication of the Terms.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> diſputes, <hi>that every proper Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Church, and therefore a National Church must have a constitutive Regent Head:</hi> Does he mean by this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Regent Head, a viſible Head on Earth, or an inviſible Head in Heaven? If he means Chriſt as an inviſible Head in Heaven, then there is no Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; for we will readily grant, that Chriſt is the Head of the National, as well as of the Catholick Church: If he means a viſible Head on Earth, then <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> is no fourth Term, but only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means by a conſtitutive Regent Head: And then the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93053:121"/>Argument holds good from a National, to the Catholick Church. That if a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, as a proper Political Church, muſt have a viſible Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Regent Head on Earth eſſential to it; then the Catholick Church, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Political Church, muſt have a viſible conſtitutive Regent Head on Earth eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to it; or Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Argument is not true, that every proper Political Church muſt have a viſible Regent Head on Earth eſſential to it.</p>
               <p>Thus, I think, the Dean is once more defended, but I muſt ſpeak one good word for my ſelf too, as Charity obliges me. Mr. <hi>H. ſays,</hi> I bring in a fifth Term, <hi>ſubordinate</hi> viſible Head. But this is only a farther explication of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Terms to prevent their cavilling eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſays, every proper Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Church muſt have a conſtitutive Regent Head; does he mean this of Chriſt, as the ſupreme Head of his Church; or of men, whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, as a ſubordinate Head under Chriſt? if the firſt, there is no diſpute between us; for Chriſt is the Head of every part of his Church: If the ſecond, <hi>a ſubordinate Head,</hi> then <hi>ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi> is neither a fourth nor a fifth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93053:121"/>Term, but included in a conſtitutive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Head; and I think I need not ſpend time to prove, that Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of adding <hi>Monarchical,</hi> to a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubordinate conſtitutive Regent Head, is not a parallel caſe; becauſe Monarchical would be properly a fourth Term, as not being neceſſarily involved in a conſtitutive Regent Head, as <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Subordinate</hi> are; for a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Regent Head may be either Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical or Collective, but ſignifies neither determinately, unleſs it be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only obſerve, how Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> are apparently guilty of this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy themſelves, of introducing a fourth and a fifth Term in anſwer to the Deans Argument. If a National Church, as a proper Political Church, muſt have a conſtitutive Regent Head, then the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church as a proper Political Church muſt have a conſtitutive Regent Head: Yes, ſaith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſo it hath; for Chriſt is the conſtitutive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Head of the Catholick Church. Where we plainly ſee, that in the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, by a conſtitutive Regent Head, they underſtand a Viſible, Subordinate, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays, an accidental Head of the Church; and in the Conſequent, a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93053:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſupreme inviſible Head of the Church, which is as fallacious a way of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it is of arguing. And now I leave the Reader to judge, where the ſhame, which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſo much talks of, muſt at laſt reſt. But Ignorance and Inſenſibility <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Concerning that one Communion, which is eſſential to the Catholick Church, and the practicableneſs of it.</head>
               <p>IN the eighth Chapter of the Defence, I briefly ſtated, what the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, which is eſſential to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Univerſal Church; and what place there can be for this Catholick Communion, in this broken and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſtate of the Church, which we ſee at this day. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his Anſwer, Chap. 6. attempts to ſay ſomething to it, but it is ſuch a ſomething, as needs no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer; for it all proceeds upon his own blundering or wilful miſtakes about the nature of Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93053:122"/>and a ſupreme Regent Head of the Catholick Church: And both theſe I have diſcourſed ſo fully already, that I cannot excuſe my ſelf to my Reader, ſhould I repeat over the ſame things again; and therefore I ſhall only brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly conſider ſome few new Objections he has ſtarted, which though they are very trifling, yet may diſturb an injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader.</p>
               <p>I aſſerted, <hi>That Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrictly ſo called,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defence p. 595.</note> 
                  <hi>conſiſts,</hi> 1. <hi>In the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and Concord of the Biſhops of the Catholick Church among themſelves, and with each other.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (1) plays the Critick: <hi>He knows not,</hi> he ſays, <hi>how Agreement and Concord differ; nor among themſelves, and with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Nor it may be,<note place="margin">Anſwer. p. 212.</note> is there any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial difference between them; but is this ſuch an unpardonable fault, to uſe Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonomous words, eſpecially when a man has to deal with ſuch cavillers? It is a good ſign Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has no great matter to ſay, when he condeſcends to play at ſo low a game.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But he adds, <hi>does this man dream, that no Biſhops are Chriſtians and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, that have any diſagreement? That is no two in the World.</hi> I hope many
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93053:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>Biſhops agree better than Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks they do; who agreeing with no body himſelf, judges of others by his own wrangling humour: But yet I believe Biſhops may diſagree about many things, and yet preſerve the Concord and Unity of the Epiſcopacy in one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion: St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> I am ſure, thought this very poſſible, when he allows of ſuch differences without breaking Communion; and that in ſo high a point, as the rebaptization of Hereticks.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>But is Communion of Biſhops only neceſſary to Church-unity? Why not of Presbyters alſo?</hi> Communion of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with their Biſhop, is eſſential to the Unity of a particular Church, as I had diſcourſed in the <hi>6th.</hi> Chapter of the Defence; but the Union of one Church with another, principally conſiſts in the Agreement and Concord of Biſhops, who are the chief Governors of their Churches: And thoſe Presbyters, who live in Communion with their Biſhop, are ſuppoſed to live in Communion with thoſe, who are in Communion with him: Or if any Presbyter ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, this makes no ſchiſm between the Churches, only makes him himſelf a Schiſmatick.</p>

               <p n="3">3. But, ſays Mr. <hi>B. Who doubts but there must be Communion?</hi> I am glad to hear this is out of doubt; I aſſure him, I do not doubt of it. <hi>But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whether it must be in or under an Ariſtocratical Soveraign?</hi> But whoſe Queſtion is this Sir? It is none of mine, for I always denyed it, and made no queſtion about it: I ſuppoſe you would have ſaid, this ſhould have been the Queſtion, and then you had had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay to it. It is a troubleſome thing, I confeſs, to meet with a perverſe Diſputant, who denies wrong, and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that ſide of the Queſtion, which we are not prepared to oppoſe.</p>
               <p>Well, but I aſſert out of St. <hi>Cyprian, That no man can have the Authority or Honour of a Biſhop, who does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, that is, who does not live in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with his Fellow-Biſhops.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſuppreſſes the name of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whoſe Authority is venerable in the Chriſtian Church, and leaves out <hi>the Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Epiſcopacy,</hi> and is reſolved to confute this raw pitiful notion under the name of <hi>Sherlock,</hi> not of St. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and thus he aſſaults it.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:93053:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>But what <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity? No one that liveth not in a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion in the eſſentials of Chriſtianity and Ministry? But</hi> Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom <hi>and</hi> Theophilus Alex. <hi>and</hi> Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, <hi>might all be Biſhops, though they had much diſcord, and condemned one another. And ſo might</hi> Cyril, <hi>and</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>and</hi> Johan. Antioch, <hi>and</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret, <hi>and the</hi> Orthodox, <hi>and the</hi> Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, <hi>and the</hi> Eaſtern <hi>and</hi> Weſtern <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſince; and the Old and the New ſort of</hi> Engliſh <hi>Biſhops, if they differ not</hi> totâ Specie.</p>
               <p>I wondered this <hi>totâ Specie</hi> did not come in before: For theſe Quarrels and Contentions of <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops is one principal Argument, whereby Mr. <hi>B.</hi> proves, that they differ <hi>totâ Specie,</hi> from the true Apoſtolical, <hi>i. e.</hi> Parochial Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; and we have got ſome ground by this, that he owns, they may be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, notwithſtanding they had much Diſcord, and condemned one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Novatian</hi> Biſhops, who were guilty of a formal Schiſm from the Catholick Church, they may be called Biſhops, as the <hi>Novatian</hi> People might be called Chriſtians, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given a particular Account of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93053:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>from St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but they were not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Biſhops, as the <hi>Novatians</hi> were not Catholick Chriſtians; though for ought I perceive Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians</hi> as good Biſhops as the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Caſe of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, Theophilus Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that was a perſonal Quarrel, and though this indeed deſtroyed that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which ought to have been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between theſe good men, who were all of them Biſhops, yet it did not deſtroy <hi>the Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi> which was the only Unity of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, I aſſerted neceſſary to Catholick Communion; though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conceal that, to make his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appear more plauſible. The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Epiſcopacy conſiſts in this, that all Biſhops live in the Communion of the ſame Church, as members of the ſame Body, and as near as they can, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Churches by mutual Advice and Conſent; This St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did in the height of their Quarrel: They owned the ſame Church, and governed their reſpective Churches by the ſame Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Laws and Canons, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93053:125"/>ſerved the Unity of the Epiſcopacy: But <hi>Theophilus</hi> had a perſonal Quarrel againſt St. <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> and drew <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> and ſome other Biſhops to his ſide, and did at laſt prevail ſo far, as to depoſe him, very undeſervedly. This was a very great fault in theſe good men, a very ſcandalous breach between theſe Biſhops, but no Schiſm in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy: For they ſtill acknowledged the ſame Order, the ſame Communion, and the ſame Rules of Eccleſiaſtical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. But of this more anon.</p>
               <p>I obſerved in the Defence,<note place="margin">Defence, p. 596.</note> that there were ſeveral ways, whereby this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion among Biſhops was expreſſed and maintained. As 1. By writing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to, and receiving Letters from one another about Church-Affairs; and I inſtanced in their ſending the names of any Biſhops elected into vacant Sees, that they might know, who were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Biſhops, and who not. To this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> anſwers. 1. <hi>So do the</hi> Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents <hi>and</hi> Presbyterians; what do they do? Write Letters? No doubt of it! And ſo did the <hi>Novatians,</hi> and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi> and yet were Schiſmaticks for all that. And this was one reaſon, why the Catholick Biſhops gave an account
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93053:125"/>to each other, who were their Colleagues, that ſo they might be aware of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Schiſmaticks. I hope, it is no argument, that Catholick Biſhops can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expreſs and maintain Catholick Communion by ſuch Letters, becauſe Schiſmaticks may in the ſame way main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Schiſmatical Confederacy. But ſays Mr. <hi>B. do none this</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> write Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) <hi>but a Soveraign Senate?</hi> Yes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Biſhops did, as I inſtanced in St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who ſent a Catalogue of the names of Catholick Biſhops to <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> But 2. <hi>Is this the Communion that unifyeth the Church? I hope it is a Church, and men are members of it, before they write Letters.</hi> No doubt at all! But did I ſay, that the Communion of the Church conſiſted in writing Letters, or that it was expreſſed and maintained by it? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is a very unhappy man at diſtinctions; he can never find a good diſtinction, when there is want of it; and never wants diſtinctions, where there is no difference.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next way of maintaining Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion among Biſhops, I obſerved, was <hi>by adviſing together about the publick affairs of the Church, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating Counſels with each other, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93053:126"/>giving an account of the reaſons of their Actions, (that there might be no miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing between them)</hi> theſe laſt words, which I have included in a Parentheſis, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has left out of his Citation, becauſe they did too plainly diſcover, how this mutual Advice and Counſel did tend to maintain Catholick Unity. And anſwers, 1. <hi>This</hi> Independents <hi>are ready to do:</hi> What then? Does it hence follow, that they are Catholick Biſhops? Schiſmaticks may do many things, which true Catholick Chriſtians do, and be Schiſmaticks ſtill. 2. <hi>How doth this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the former? Do you not mean adviſing by Letters or Meſſengers? If not, is it general Councils you mean, or what?</hi> I told my meaning very plain: Sometimes one particular Biſhop writ to another. Sometimes Neighbour Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops met in Provincial Synods, and ſent their Synodical Letters to Forraign Churches. But this is writing Letters ſtill, and how does it differ from the former? Why Sir, only as a Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an account of the preſent ſtate of the Church, what Biſhops die, and who are ordained in their ſtead, who are Catholicks, and who are Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, does from a Letter of Advice and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93053:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>Counſel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>how is it we muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with them of</hi> Armenia, Abaſſia, <hi>and the reſt?</hi> When Mr. <hi>B.</hi> can prove, that I make it neceſſary to do ſo, I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to find out a way to do it; but this, and what follows about Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Counſels, has been ſufficiently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered above.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> proceeds, <hi>But how? Is it only publick Affairs that the Colledge ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth you about?</hi> The Man dreams, who talks of the advice of the Colledge? <hi>Who is it then that muſt diſpoſe of the Church, State, and Souls of all us Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals?</hi> Every particular Biſhop with the aſſiſtance of his <hi>Presbyters,</hi> muſt take care of his own Church, and the Souls committed to him; and that he may do this the better, in all difficult <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, eſpecially ſuch as concern the whole Church, muſt take the beſt Advice of his Fellow-Biſhops, that he can, where is the abſurdity of all this? Surely Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes himſelf more ignorant than he is, when he adds, <hi>It ſeems it is ſome body below the Senate, that is meant, when we are told, that we must obey the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church. I thought whither it would come at last.</hi> And well he might think whither it would come, when he
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93053:127"/>was reſolved whither to carry it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I obſerved another way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing and maintaining this Catholick Communion, <hi>was by Letters of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation granted to</hi> Presbyters, <hi>or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Christians (who had occaſion to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel) from thoſe Churches of which they were members, to other Churches, whither they went, which were called Formed or Communicatory Letters, the uſe of which I there explained.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> anſwers. 1. <hi>Are not all theſe three Proofs the ſame, writing Letters of Church-affairs, Conſultation, and Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Yes, writing Letters is writing Letters moſt certainly, but I imagine there may be ſome difference with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Subject about which men write: And that Letters of recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation differ ſomething from Letters of advice. 2. <hi>Do any of us deny his Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that this proveth Communion among them?</hi> Why then does he not own this Catholick Communion which I contend for, and which infallibly proves him to be a Schiſmatick? No, but I ſhould prove <hi>an Epiſcopal Colledge, as one Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocratical ſupreme Regent Head.</hi> I thank him for nothing, I am not at leiſure to write ſuch Books on purpoſe for him to confute them.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:93053:127"/>
               <p>But, 3. He ſays, <hi>theſe communicatory Letters the Non-conformiſts are greatly for; that no man may be admitted to Communion in any particular Church, without either a Perſonal understanding, owning of his Baptiſmal Covenant, or a Teſtimonial, that he hath done it, and been received into Communion with ſome Church, with whom we have ſuch Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as is due between ſeveral Churches.</hi> Quidlibet ex Quolibet! How cleverly has Mr. <hi>B.</hi> turned theſe Communicatory Letters into an examination by Lay El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or an <hi>Independent</hi> Church-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and the one Communion of the Catholick Church, into <hi>ſuch a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as is due between ſeveral Churches?</hi> I could wiſh as heartily as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that greater care were taken in the Diſcipline of the Church, though they who make the greateſt Complaints of the want of it, are the true cauſe of this defect. But what is this to Communicatory Letters? Or what if Schiſmaticks are for Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatory Letters among themſelves, are they ever the leſs Schiſmaticks for that? All that I deſigned to prove by theſe Communicatory Letters, was this; that the Ancient Church did believe, that every Chriſtian as a Chriſtian was a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93053:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>member of the Catholick Church, and had a right to Chriſtian-communion where he came; which cannot be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all Chriſtians are one Body, and all particular Churches, members of one Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>And here I had occaſion to expreſs my diſſent from a very great man, whoſe memory is as dear and venerable to me, as to moſt of his particular and intimate Friends. I mean Dr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> and I think I expreſs my diſſent from him with all that modeſty, and juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which is due to his memory. I acknowledged that he had abundantly confuted that notion of a Conſtitutive Regent Head of the Catholick Church, but yet that he made Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion too arbitrary a thing, like the Confederacies of Soveraign Princes. I ſhould be heartily glad to ſee my ſelf confuted in this point, and to find that I was miſtaken in his judgment in this matter; if at leaſt it may be called his Judgment, and not rather his Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</p>
               <p>I will not diſpute with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> about the judgment of this Reverend Perſon; for I do not find, that he underſtands either of us: I am ſure he urges ſuch
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93053:128"/>things in his Defence, as that great man would be aſhamed of; and I will not be ſo injurious to his memory ſo much as to repeat them: I may have occaſion to take notice of what he ſays upon ſome other ſcore, but Dr. <hi>Barrows</hi> name ſhall not be concerned in it.</p>
               <p>And now I come to the grand diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of all, which I did but juſt name in the Defence: <hi>What place there can be for Catholick Communion in this broken and divided state of the Church, which we ſee at this day:</hi> If there be no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church without Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, where ſhall we find the Catholick Church at this day, when ſo very few Churches live in Communion with each other? This makes ſome men ſuſpect, that Catholick Communion is a pretty Romantick notion of a Catholick Church, but ſo impracticable, that it is of no uſe to us now, nor will put an end to any one Controverſie or Schiſm in the Chriſtian Church. But this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, when it is thorowly examin'd, will vaniſh of it ſelf. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are Schiſms in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, is certainly no very good Argument againſt the neceſſity of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion; and yet this is
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93053:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>the whole force of the Objection: That if Catholick Communion be eſſential to the Catholick Church, we muſt reduce the Catholick Church into a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs, and un-Church moſt of the Chriſtian Churches in the World, as not maintaining this Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: If this be ſo, I am heartily ſorry for it, as every good man will be for the Degeneracy and Apoſtacy of any part of the Chriſtian Church. But would Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> have me frame ſome new Notions of Catholick-unity and Schiſm, to juſtifie the many Schiſms and Separations of the Chriſtian World? Muſt we fit our Notions of Church-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the preſent divided ſtate of the Church, or endeavour to reduce a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and divided Church to a true Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſtate of Unity? Suppoſe I had proved, that Catholick Doctrine inſtead of Catholick Communion, had been only eſſential to the being of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and ſuch another Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhould urge me with this inconvenience, that then there are very few Churches, that are true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick Church: Becauſe in moſt Ages, and at this day, there are ſuch great breaches between ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93053:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>Churches about what they think the moſt fundamental Articles of our Faith; muſt I therefore deny the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Catholick Doctrine to a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, for fear of that inference, that then there are many large and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Churches, which are not true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Apoſtolick Churches? This is the way, I confeſs, never to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Catholick Church; to make the Catholick Church to be what the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Churches are, not what they ought to be: But it is the way alſo to make a new Chriſtianity in every Age.</p>
               <p>And this is the more conſiderable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many of the Schiſms, which now are, and have been in many Ages of the Church, are owing to different appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions in matters of Faith, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, or have been thought to be Catholick Doctrines: Such are the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between the Greek and Latine Churches; the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Reformed Churches; the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Churches: So that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> muſt either find out a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Catholick Doctrine, as well as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Catholick Communion, or muſt reduce the Catholick Church almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as narrow a compaſs for want of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93053:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>Doctrine, as for want of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion: Unleſs he can prove, that theſe doctrinal Diſputes are not of that Moment, as to cauſe Schiſms in the Church; and then he will mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large Catholick Communion, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this formidable Objection him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">II. No man can pretend, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion is in its own nature impracticable, becauſe it was <hi>de Facto,</hi> religiouſly obſerved in the Primitive Church for ſeveral Ages. Thus it was in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s, thus it was in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>'s time, who made Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion eſſential to the being of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church: And that cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be thought an impracticable Notion, which has been practiſed in the Chriſtian Church, and which is equally neceſſary to be practiſed in all Ages.</p>
               <p n="3">III. For what ſhould hinder all good Chriſtians from maintaining Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all Chriſtian Churches, which are ſound and orthodox in Faith, and Worſhip? If there be ſuch Churches to be found in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. What ſhould hinder any ſober Chriſtian, who travels into thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and underſtands their Language,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93053:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>from joyning with them in all acts of Worſhip, as Members of the ſame Body of Chriſt? Thoſe Churches, which are not ſound and Orthodox, are not the Objects of Chriſtian Communion, and it is no breach of Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to communicate with them: And nothing can reaſonably hinder our Communion with thoſe, that are. For where there are no ſinful terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion impoſed, we are bound to all Acts of Communion, as opportunity ſerves.</p>
               <p>So that thoſe, who think it ſuch an impoſſible thing to maintain Catholick Communion among the Chriſtian Churches of this Age, muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe, that there are very few Churches in the World at this time, which a ſound and orthodox Chriſtian can communicate with; for nothing elſe can make Catholick Communion impoſſible. And if this be true, it is a very ſad conſideration, and deeply to be lamented of all Chriſtians, but it is that, which I cannot help: Catholick Communion is very feaſible, when there are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Catholick Churches to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with, but when there are none, it cannot be had; or if there be
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93053:131"/>but a few ſuch, it muſt be maintained among thoſe few, that are; and that is true Catholick Communion, which includes all true Catholick Churches, be they more or leſs.</p>
               <p>But the thing at preſent to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is this, whether he, who denies any Church to be a true Catholick Church, which does not maintain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, makes the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church any narrower than he does, who denies the poſſibility of Catholick Communion, becauſe there are very few Churches, which a good Chriſtian can ſafely communicate with. For I ſuppoſe, thoſe are no true Catholick Churches, which a Catholick Chriſtian muſt not communicate with; and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion may be maintained among all other Churches, whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is not ſinful and dangerous.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance,<note place="margin">Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack</hi> p. 189.</note> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> reckons up twelve Sects of Chriſtians in the World, as Members of the Catholick Church; his only doubt being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> I ask Mr. <hi>B.</hi> then, whether theſe Churches be ſo ſound and orthodox, that a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may communicate with them? If they be, then here is a poſſibility of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93053:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>maintaining Catholick Communion with all the Churches in the World, at leaſt excepting the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> If they be not, how are they Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Churches? Are thoſe Catholick Churches, which are ſo corrupt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, that a Catholick Chriſtian muſt not own their Communion? Catholick Communion may certainly be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe Churches, whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is lawful; and I think it as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that thoſe Churches cannot be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick Church, whoſe Communion is unlawful.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. We may conſider farther, that in this preſent ſtate of things, there are not many poſitive Acts of Communion neceſſary to preſerve Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between Forraign Churches; and therefore Catholick Communion is not ſo impracticable, as ſome may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. The Churches of diſtant Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot worſhip God together, nor eaſily meet for Advice and Counſel, but they may own and receive each others Members, as occaſion ſerves, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies their Communion with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nay, where there is no breach of Communion, no declared diſowning of each other, nor expreſs denial of any
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93053:132"/>Act of Communion between diſtant Churches, thoſe Churches may be ſaid to be in Communion with each other. There are ſome Chriſtian Churches, which we know little or nothing of, nor they of us; but while we break not Communion with any ſound part of the Chriſtian Church, and profeſs Communion with all that are ſo, we may be truly ſaid to live in Catholick Communion with the whole Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>It is true, as I obſerved in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, in the Primitive Church they maintained Communion with diſtant Churches, by Formed and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Letters; by giving notice to each other of the ſtate of their ſeveral Churches, and adviſing and conſulting about Church Affairs; which was a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent means of maintaining a ſtricter Communion and fair Correſpondence between them; and was eſpecially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at that time, when they lived under <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperors, and the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Unity of the Church was upheld only by Eccleſiaſtical Authority: But this was not abſolutely neceſſary to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, and is in a great meaſure impracticable now: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93053:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>being divided into the hands of ſeveral Independent Chriſtian Monarchs, who have the ſupreme Power in all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, as well as civil Cauſes, there can be no ſuch actual Correſpondence between the Churches of ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but by their conſent and leave: Soveraign Princes, not Subjects, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, muſt treat with one another about the great Affairs of Church and State, though with the advice of their Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Counſellors: But ſtill thoſe Churches are in Communion with each other, who own each other as Members of the ſame Body, and deny no Act of Chriſtian Communion to each other, as opportunity ſerves. And whether this be ſo very difficult, much leſs impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let any man judge.</p>
               <p n="5">V. To make this appear ſtill more eaſie and practicable, we may conſider, that the Terms of Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are not ſo ſtraight and narrow, as ſome men make them. This is the true reaſon of moſt of the Schiſms in the Chriſtian Church, that ſome raſh and inconſiderate People think, that every little difference, and petty controverſie is a ſufficient reaſon to divide the Church
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93053:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſet up diſtinct and ſeparate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions: and have eſpouſed ſuch narrow Principles of Church Communion, that it is almoſt impoſſible any two Churches ſhould long hang together; much leſs that all the Churches in the world ſhould agree in ſuch matters. This Argument deſerves a more particular conſideration, as diſcovering the original of Church-diviſions and the cure of them; and therefore I ſhall briefly conſider upon what terms Catholick Communion may be maintained in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>Now the terms of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion may be reduced to theſe four general Heads; 1. Doctrine; 2. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; 3. Diſcipline; 4. Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="1">I. As for what concerns the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, I preſume my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries will readily grant, that an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Fundamentals is a ſufficient Foundation for Catholick Communion; and I will as readily grant, that no Church which denies any Fundamental Article of our Religion, ought to be owned for a Catholick Church, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into Catholick Communion. To deny Communion to any ſuch perſon, or Church, is no ſchiſm, no more than
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93053:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>it is to cut off a rotten and gangreened Member from the Body. And if it ſhould appear, that many or moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches are over-run with ſuch Hereſies, as deſtroy the foundations of Chriſtianity, this muſt of neceſſity mightily ſtraighten Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; not becauſe Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is in it ſelf an impracticable notion, but becauſe there are but few Catholick Churches to communicate with; for it is as neceſſary a duty not to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with Churches, which renounce Catholick Doctrine, as it is to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with thoſe, which own it; we being under the ſame Obligations to maintain all fundamental Doctrines of Faith, as to preſerve the Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Chriſtian Church: For indeed it is an ill way to preſerve the Peace of the Chriſtian Church, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting our Chriſtianity, as every funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Hereſie does; or to enlarge Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion, by receiving thoſe into our Communion, who are no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>And I ſuppoſe, none of my adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will require me to give ſuch a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of fundamental Doctrines, as are neceſſary to qualifie any Church for
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93053:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>Catholick Communion: Both <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in their Diſputes about Fundamentals, have always waved this, and there is no reaſon any harder terms ſhould be put upon me; and thus I might end this Diſpute honourably e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; for as far as reſpects Doctrines, every man muſt acknowledg, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, may be as large as Catholick Doctrine, and that is as large, as it ought to be.</p>
               <p>But yet for the greater ſatisfaction of my Readers, and of my ſelf, I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe this matter more particularly; for I confeſs, I do not underſtand the reaſon, why ſo many great men of our Church, as have writ againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſince the happy reformation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among us, have been ſo tender in this point; if we cannot tell, what are the fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, how can we be aſſured, that we, or any other Church do not err funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally? and how can we know, that the whole Church has not ſo erred, but only by that general promiſe, that the whole Church ſhould not fall into fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental errors? and if we can tell what Doctrines are fundamental, methinks it is not impoſſible, if occaſion were, to give a Catalogue of them.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:93053:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>I am far enough from being of that mind, <hi>That a Catalogue of Fundamentals is impoſſible, becauſe to ſome, more is fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, to others leſs, to others nothing at all, becauſe God requires more of them to whom he gives more, and leſs of them, to whom he gives leſs.</hi> Which indeed does not only prove, that it is impoſſible to aſſign a Catalogue of Fundamentals, but that there is nothing in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fundamental in Chriſtianity, but only for every man to believe, as much of it as he can.</p>
               <p>Yet the Caution of ſo many great men in this Matter, makes me very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, how nice a thing it is to talk of Fundamentals, and what unpardonable arrogance it would be in any private man, to be peremptory and dogmatical in aſſigning a Catalogue of them; and therefore I ſhall only pretend to make ſome Eſſay of this nature, which the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I am now engaged in, and the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Objections of ſome men extort from me; for if we cannot in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure tell, what are the terms of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion, Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt needs be a very impracticable notion. And to prepare the way, I ſhall briefly obſerve ſome few things to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93053:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>prevent ſome cavilling Objections, and Prejudices againſt the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by Fundamentals, I mean ſuch Doctrines as are eſſential to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and diſtinguiſh the Chriſtian Religion from all other Religions: Now if we will acknowledg, that Chriſtian Religion is a fixt and certain thing, we muſt acknowledg, that there are ſuch Fundamentals, as are fixt and certain too, and do not alter with mens diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Apprehenſions, Capacities, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Inſtruction; and if it be poſſible to underſtand the true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Chriſtianity, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religions, it is poſſible to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what the Fundamentals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The greateſt difficulty, which is objected againſt a Catalogue of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, does equally lie againſt the belief of Chriſtianity it ſelf. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is this, that the belief of all Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals is neceſſary to Salvation, and therefore whoever aſſigns a Catalogue of Fundamentals, damns all thoſe who are of a different Opinion, which therefore is a work fit only for a daring and uncharitable man, or haereticating
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93053:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>Councils, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls them.</p>
               <p>Now in the ſame manner I may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue againſt the neceſſity of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith it ſelf. Whoever aſſerts it neceſſary to Salvation to believe in Chriſt, damns all <hi>Jews, Pagans, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> and all <hi>Infidels,</hi> which ſeems at leaſt as hard a thing, as to damn all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who bear no proportion at all to the number of <hi>Infidels;</hi> and yet if the Chriſtian Faith it ſelf be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, it muſt be neceſſary to Salvation, to believe ſome Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; for we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſtianity, without believing ſuch Articles as contain the eſſentials of Chriſtian Faith, which do not alter with the Prejudices, Prepoſſeſſions, and Capacities of men, no more than Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity it ſelf. And yet neither I, nor any man elſe, have any thing to do to paſs a final Sentence, either upon <hi>Infidels</hi> or <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but they muſt ſtand or fall to their own Maſter. There may be a ſtanding rule of Faith and Manners, whereby men ſhall be judged, but how far the ſoveraign and uncovenanted Grace of God may diſpence with this rule in equitable Caſes, is not my buſineſs to determine. But of this more hereafter.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:93053:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="3">3. I obſerve, there are ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which, if they be true, muſt be fundamental Truths, if they be falſe, muſt be fundamental Errors; becauſe they alter the very Foundations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and make two very different Religions of it, as I ſhall ſhew in what follows. There are indeed a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny erroneous Doctrines, which make great alterations in the Scheme of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as all the Antinomian Doctrines do, which yet I cannot call fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Errors, becauſe they make no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference in the Doctrine of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, which is the great Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental of Chriſtianity, as you ſhall ſee more preſently; every erroneous Doctrine does not make a new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it may in a great meaſure obſerve the Glory, or ſpoil the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it upon mens minds.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I obſerve further, that there are ſome Doctrines, which are neceſſary to Catholick Communion, becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of them makes an eſſential differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Chriſtian Worſhip. Chriſtian Communion is principally exerciſed in all the Offices of Chriſtian Worſhip, and thoſe, who cannot Worſhip God together, cannot maintain Chriſtian
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93053:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>Communion with each other. Thus the belief or denial of the ſacred Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the incarnation of Chriſt, the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential alteration in moſt of the Acts of Chriſtian Worſhip: And we ſee to this day, the very <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> is an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual bar to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> from joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Communion. Now that which I am principally concerned for at preſent, is ſuch an account of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, as is neceſſary to maintain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion in the Chriſtian World.</p>
               <p>To ſtate this matter then, as plainly and briefly as I can, I ſhall 1. endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to fix the plain notion of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrines, and conſequently, of fundamental Errors. 2. I ſhall conſider the Caſe of thoſe men, who heartily believe all the fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity, and yet entertain ſuch corrupt Doctrines, as in their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and neceſſary Conſequences over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Foundations, and whether they may be ſaid to err Fundamentally. 3. How far, and in what Caſes, we may Communicate with ſuch men and Churches, as believe all Fundamentals, but yet profeſs ſuch other erroneous
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:93053:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>Doctrines, as ſeem to overthrow Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. I think this is all, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to clear this point of Catholick Communion, as it reſpects Doctrines.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To fix the plain notion of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrines; now a fundamental Doctrine is ſuch a Doctrine, as is in a ſtrict ſence of the eſſence of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: A fundamental Doctrine, without which the whole building and ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture muſt fall. The belief of which, is neceſſary to the very being of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, like the firſt principles in any Art or Science, which muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or elſe there can be no ſuch Science. Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> 
                  <hi>For other Foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That is, no man can lay any other Foundation for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; for you deſtroy the Chriſtian Religion, if you leave Chriſt out of it. And therefore the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter the ſame Apoſtle gives of Apoſtates from Chriſtianity, is that they <hi>hold not the Head,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Col. 19.</note> that is Chriſt. And St. <hi>John</hi> makes this the ſum of Chriſtian Faith. <hi>Theſe are written,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">22 Joh. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>that ye might believe, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:93053:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>and that believing ye might have life through his Name.</hi> And the neceſſary qualification of an Apoſtle, was <hi>to be a Witneſs of the Reſurrection,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Act. 22.</note> as the laſt great Confirmation, which was given to our Saviours Authority; and the ſum of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching at <hi>Athens,</hi> was <hi>Jeſus and the Reſurrection,</hi> which <hi>the Philoſophers of the</hi> Epicureans <hi>and</hi> Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks <hi>miſtake for ſtrange Gods.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">17 Act. 18.</note> And the Commiſſion Chriſt gave his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">24 Luk. 47.</note> was <hi>to preach Repentance and remiſſion of Sins in his Name.</hi> So that Salvation by Chriſt is the general fundamental Doctrine of the Goſpel. Take away this, and you deſtroy the eſſential Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Chriſtian Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is diſtinguiſh'd from all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions.</p>
               <p>But then as for particular Doctrines and Articles of Faith, thoſe are Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, which are either neceſſarily included in, or inſeparably conjoyned with this general fundamental of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt. For we muſt not think it enough to believe in general, that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a more explicite underſtanding of the meaning of that Propoſition; who this Jeſus is, what it is to be the Chriſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:93053:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>and the Son of God, and how we are ſaved by him; and this we muſt learn from the Revelations of the Goſpel; the more neceſſary connexion there is between any particular Doctrine, and that great fundamental of Salvation by Chriſt, the more neceſſary and fundamental it is; which ſeems to me to be the trueſt and eaſieſt Character, that can be given of a fundamental Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Thus far I think I am ſafe, but it may be thought a hazardous attempt to launch out any farther, or particularly to define, what thoſe particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Chriſtian Religion are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot rightly believe Salvation by Chriſt. Though I cannot ſee, but that this may be done ſafely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if we uſe due caution in it: and I ſhall venture to offer ſomething of this nature, both to ſatisfie inquiſitive men, why ſuch and ſuch Doctrines have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been accounted fundamental by the Catholick Church, and to diſtinguiſh what is fundamental from ſome more nice and curious ſpeculations, which is of mighty uſe in the preſent diſpute about Catholick Communion.</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:93053:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>And not to pretend to give a perfect Catalogue of Fundamentals, I ſhall only give a taſte of this in ſome few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which have given occaſion to the fierceſt Diſputes in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall begin with the Doctrine of the holy Trinity, which hath in all Ages been accounted a fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Faith, and hath as good reaſon to be thought ſo, as any other, ſince we are baptized into this belief: For to <hi>baptize into the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> according to the moſt proper ſignification of the words, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Catholick Church, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to baptize into the Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the ſacred Trinity; as I think, I could eaſily ſhew at large, were it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per upon this occaſion.</p>
               <p>And how eſſential this belief is to the right underſtanding of the Doctrine of man's Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, which is the comprehenſive fundamental of Chriſtian Religion, will eaſily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by any man, who careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiders, how each Perſon in the ever bleſſed Trinity is concerned in the Oeconomy of man's Salvation.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:93053:139"/>
               <p>The Father in infinite pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to fallen man, <hi>gives his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that whoſoever believes in him, might not periſh, but have everlaſting Life:</hi> He gives him to become man, and to die as a Sacrifice for ſin, and to ſeal a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace and Mercy in his blood.</p>
               <p>The Son moved by the ſame love and pity, gives himſelf, becomes man, dies for the attonement and expiation of our ſins; riſes again from the dead, and takes poſſeſſion of his mediatory King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, becomes the Lord and Judge both of the quick and the dead, and according to his promiſe ſends his Spirit upon his Apoſtles in miraculous gifts and powers, to qualifie them for the work of the Miniſtry; and beſtows the ſame holy Spirit upon the whole Chriſtian Church, and every ſincere member of it, as an abiding principle of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and a new Life.</p>
               <p>The holy Spirit accordingly comes, and dwells in his Church, and in good men, as in his Temple, ſanctifies them in this World to be veſſels of Honour, and will hereafter raiſe their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into immortal Life.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:93053:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>So that each Perſon in the Sacred Trinity is peculiarly concerned in the Salvation of Mankind; and we cannot truly believe the great fundamental Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the belief of the holy Trinity, of Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, one eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and infinite God.</p>
               <p>The God-head of the Father is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all, but whoever denies the Godhead of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, overthrows the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation by Chriſt, as it is taught in the new Teſtament, and makes it quite another thing, and a very little thing too; as to ſhew this briefly.</p>
               <p>He who makes Chriſt to be either the moſt excellent Creature, as the <hi>Arians</hi> did, or a meer man, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, mightily leſſen the Grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God to ſinners, which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as ſuch a ſtupendious act of Love, <hi>that God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son:</hi> now if this <hi>only begotten Son,</hi> be only the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and excellent Creature, eſpecially if he be but a meer man, the love and the deſign is not ſo ſtupendious and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing; for God has an equal propriety in all his Creatures, and it is no ſuch
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93053:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>prizing Myſtery, that a good God ſhould give one of his Creatures, though never ſo excellent, eſpecially if he be but one excellent man, for the redmp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo many Millions; eſpecially when he promiſes to reward this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking with ſuch a ſuperexcellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Glory and Power. The love of God in redeeming us, by what means ſoever, is very great; but his love in giving <hi>his only begotten Son</hi> for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, where Chriſt himſelf lays the emphaſis, if this only begotten Son be but a Creature or a man, is not ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful.</p>
               <p>Thus it ſounds very odly, for a Creature to be the Saviour of mankind, to be the object of a religious Faith, and Hope, and Truſt, and Dependance: The Worſhip of Chriſt cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, if he be not God, and a <hi>made God</hi> is a contradiction in the terms, unleſs we mean only a titular God, and a titular God, cannot be the Object of Religious Worſhip. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible, how the blood of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can make a proper atonement and expiation for ſin, and therefore the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> who deny Chriſt to be God, are very conſiſtent with themſelves in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93053:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>his ſatisfaction: A Creature is not capable of infinite and omnipotent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, no more than a finite Nature, (as the moſt excellent created Nature is) can be the Subject of infinite perfections; and therefore if Chriſt be not God, he cannot have all Power in Heaven and Earth committed to him; he cannot have it in his own Perſon, becauſe he is not capable of it, and cannot exerciſe it: He can at moſt only bear the name, but the Government of the World, muſt be in another hand, which is able to manage it.</p>
               <p>Let us then now conſider, what a fundamental difference the denyal of the divinity of our Saviour makes in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation by Chriſt, which I ſhall repreſent by drawing two Schemes of the Doctrine of Salvation, one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding upon the belief of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our Saviour, the other upon ſuppoſition, that he is only an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Creature, or meer man.</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:93053:141"/>
               <p>Chriſt the eternal Son of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God out of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love to fallen man, gave his eternal and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son to be our Saviour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This eternal Son of God in the fulneſs of time, appeared in the World in humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, confirmed his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by miracles, which he wrought by his own divine Power, purchaſed and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Church by his own Blood, by which he made a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect expiation for our ſins, and ſealed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace and Pardon.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:93053:141"/>

               </p>
               <p>This ſhort account makes it very evident, what a fundamental difference the belief or denial of the Divinity of our Saviour, makes in the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation by Chriſt. The firſt makes it an Act of ſtupendious love in God, in giving his own Son to be a Propitiation for our ſins; the ſecond is a great act of love in ſaving ſinners, but the manner is not ſo full of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and myſterious Goodneſs. The firſt makes it an act of infinite Love and Condeſcention in Chriſt to become Man, a Miniſter and a Servant, and to ſubmit to an accurſed death for our ſakes. <hi>That though he were rich, yet for our ſakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich:</hi> But the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond infers no ſuch thing, as I can ſee: If he were nothing greater than a man, it was no condeſcention in him to be made a man; eſpecially if he had no being before he was born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:93053:142"/>
                  <hi>Mary,</hi> it was no more matter of his choice to become man, than it is of any other man, who is born into the World; and therefore could be no Act of Love or Condeſcenſion.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſuppoſe that Chriſt were the moſt glorious and excellent Creature, yet being a Creature, there is not ſuch a vaſt difference between the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Creature and a perfect Man, as there is between a God, and the moſt perfect Creature; it is no ſuch mighty debaſement for the moſt glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to appear in pure and untainted Fleſh and Blood; eſpecially upon ſuch a glorious deſign as the redemption of mankind: Though the diſguiſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance may be thought below an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Nature, yet the Character with which he appears, as the great Prophet and Saviour of the World, is as much above it. The meaneſt ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of humane nature, a poor deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and laborious Life, the moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ignominious death, which makes the moſt excellent Creature, the Saviour of mankind, and advances him to be Lord and Judge of the World, is ſo far from being an Act of condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love in the moſt glorious Creature,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93053:143"/>that it is above his Ambition, and would be like the pride of Lucifer, to be equal to God.</p>
               <p>To become man, to ſuffer and die for the redemption of the World, and to be made the Lord and Judge both of the quick and of the dead, can be an act of condeſcending love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only in God. So that to deny the Divinity of Chriſt, alters the very foundations of Chriſtianity, and deſtroys all the powerful arguments of the Love, Humility, and Condeſcention of our Lord, which are the peculiar motives of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thus the belief of the Divinity of Chriſt makes God to be our Saviour, the object of our Faith, and Hope, and Relyance; the denial of it makes a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be our Saviour, and the object of a Religious Faith and Worſhip; which I think differ as much, as the Worſhip of God, and of a Creature. The firſt contains a viſible union of our Nature to the Deity, which is a viſible demonſtration of God's love and tender regard to mankind; the ſecond deprives us of this ſenſible Conſolation.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:93053:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The firſt exhibits to us a Saviour by Purchaſe and by Redemption, which is both more endearing, and a greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to our guilty fears; the ſecond makes Chriſt a Saviour, only as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or a King may be a Saviour, who ſaves by wiſe inſtructions, by preaching the way of Salvation, or by Power.</p>
               <p>The firſt reſpects the guilt of ſin, and the juſt Wrath and Diſpleaſure of God, which is the Object of our guilty fears. It offers a Saviour to us, who is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and man, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully intercedes for our Pardon in vertue of his meritorious Sacrifice; The ſecond has no reſpect to the atonement and reconciliation of God, which is the only ſecurity to a guilty Conſcience, but only contains propoſals of Peace and Reconciliation without a Sacrifice: A thing which mankind will not eaſily believe, when they are thorowly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the evil of ſin, and the inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible purity and holineſs of the divine Nature; not to take notice now, how irreconcileable this is with all the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Types of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, he who believes Chriſt to be perfect God, as well as perfect man, is eaſily ſatisfied of his Power to ſave, as
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93053:144"/>well as of the Vertue of his Sacrifice. For omnipotent Power is eſſential to the Notion of a God, and when God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our Saviour, he can exerciſe all that Power, which is neceſſary to our Salvation; but he who believes Chriſt to be but an exalted Creature, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtand how he can exerciſe om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Power, which is peculiar to God: For I think it is ſomewhat harder to underſtand, how a Creature can be made a God, and be poſſeſt of divine Perfections, ſuch as omnipotent Power is, than to believe, that God can take a Creature into a perſonal union with himſelf.</p>
               <p>This, I think, is ſufficient to ſatisfie any man, what a fundamental Change the denial of Chriſt's Divinity makes in the Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt. It makes a new Goſpel and a new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore the Divinity of Chriſt muſt be acknowledged to be a fundamental Doctrine, becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of it ſubverts Foundations.</p>
               <p>Thus to proceed, our Salvation by Chriſt does not only conſiſt in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of our ſins, and the propoſal of terms of Reconciliation, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Pardon and a Reward, but in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93053:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Communications of divine Grace and Power to renew and ſanctifie us; and this is every where in Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the holy Spirit, as his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Office in the Oeconomy of man's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and it muſt make a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal change in the Doctrine of divine Grace and aſſiſtance, to deny the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the holy Spirit. For can a Creature be the univerſal Spring and Fountain of divine Grace and Life? Can a finite Creature be a kind of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Soul to the whole Chriſtian Church, and to every ſincere member of it? Can a Creature make ſuch cloſe Applications to our minds, know our thoughts, ſet bounds to our Paſſions, inſpire us with new affections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and be more intimate to us, than we are to our ſelves? If a Creature be the only inſtrument and principle of Grace, we ſhall ſoon be tempted, either to deny the grace of God, or to make it only an external thing, and entertain very mean conceits of it. All thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gifts, which were beſtowed on the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians for the edification of the Church, were the gifts of the Spirit, all the graces of the Chriſtian Life, are the fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:93053:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>The divine Spirit is the principle of Immortality in us, which firſt gives life to our Souls, and will at the laſt day raiſe our dead bodies out of the duſt, works which ſufficiently proclaim him to be God, and which we cannot hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily believe in the Goſpel-notion of them, if he be not.</p>
               <p>Thus, we ſee, how fundamental the doctrine of the ever bleſſed Trinity is in the Chriſtian Religion, becauſe we cannot rightly underſtand the Doctrine of Salvation, nor the Covenant of Grace, without this belief; which ſeems to be the true reaſon, why the more perfect diſcovery of this was reſerved for Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-times, and only obſcurely hinted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, becauſe the peculiar uſe of it is under the Goſpel; each ſacred Perſon having a peculiar intereſt and concernment in the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And therefore all thoſe, who expreſly deny the Divinity of the Son, and of the holy Spirit, as many ancient Hereticks did of old, and as the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do at this day, do err fundamental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, however God may be merciful to their ignorance or prejudice, which it does not concern us to meddle with.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:93053:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But though it is neceſſary and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Chriſtian Faith, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt to be one eternal God, yet there are a great many little ſubtilties ſtarted by over-curious and buſie heads, which are not fundamental Doctrines, and ought not to be thought ſo: God forbid that all the nice diſtinctions and defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Schools, about Eſſence, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, Perſonalty, about eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Proceſſion, the difference between Filiation, and Spiration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be reckon'd among Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of our Faith: For though we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood nothing of theſe matters (as indeed we don't, and it had been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the Church had never heard of them) yet if we believe the Divinity of each Perſon, we believe enough to underſtand the Doctrine of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And though that fatal Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Filioque, be of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance than ſuch Scholaſtick ſubtilties, yet I cannot ſee, that it concerns the foundation of our Faith. For the <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ek</hi> Church did firmly believe the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be true God, though they would
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93053:146"/>not own, that he proceeded from the Father, and the Son, but from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only: And though we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg this to be a miſtake, yet it is not a fundamental miſtake; for the Doctrine of Salvation is ſecured by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the holy Spirit to be true God, without defining the manner of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon the ſame account that the Doctrine of the ſacred Trinity is a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Article of our Faith, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt's Incarnation alſo, and what he did and ſuffered in order to our Salvation, the meritorious Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his death, his Reſurrection from the dead, Aſſenſcion into Heaven, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us at God's right hand, and that he ſhall come again to judge the World, to reward his faithful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with a glorious Reſurrection, and eternal Life, and to puniſh the wicked with eternal Death, muſt be reckoned alſo among the Fundamentals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, becauſe we cannot rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, nor rightly believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation by Chriſt, without a belief of theſe Matters.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:93053:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>This is ſo obvious at the firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, that I need not inſiſt on the Proof of it: And therefore thoſe who deny Chriſt to be true and perfect man, as well as thoſe who deny him to be God, err fundamentally, for he could not die for us, nor expiate our ſins by his blood, if he were not man.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Modus</hi> of this Hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union, how the divine and humane nature are united in Chriſt, it muſt be acknowledged to be very unconceivable by us, and it is no great wonder it ſhould be ſo when we do not perfectly underſtand any one ſort of natural u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, not ſo much as how the parts of matter hang together, much leſs how the Soul and Body is united to make one man. But yet it is fundamental to the Chriſtian Faith to believe, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane nature are united in Chriſt, that the ſame Chriſt is both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God, and perfect man, or we muſt err fundamentally in the Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt; for neither God nor man diſtinctly and ſeparately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, can be our Saviour according to the Goſpel-notion of Salvation. God cannot ſuffer and die, and the death of a man cannot expiate ſin, nor his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:93053:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſave us; and therefore we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that God and man is ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Chriſt, that the Actions and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of each nature do as properly belong to one Chriſt, as the diſtinct O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of Body and Soul, are the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the ſame man.</p>
               <p>Upon this account, the Catholick Church condemned the Hereſies of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches.</hi> For <hi>Nestorius</hi> divided not only the Natures, but the Perſons in Chriſt, only united them in Authority and Dignity: And thus Chriſt was not an Incarnate God in one Perſon; but the Man Chriſt was taken into a nearer relation to the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, than any other Man or Creature is, but not ſo as to become one with him; which deſtroyes the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Redemption by the Blood of God: For whatever Dignity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour were conferr'd upon the man Chriſt by his relation to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or divine Word, yet his Blood was not the Blood of God, becauſe notwithſtanding this Relation to God the Son, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as much a diſtinct Perſon and Subſiſtence, as any other man is.</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:93053:147"/>
               <p>The Hereſie of <hi>Eutyches</hi> is certainly equally dangerous; for he ran ſo far from the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Hereſie of two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that he denyed two natures in Chriſt: He did not deny, but that there was a humane and divine nature before their union, but he aſſerted ſuch an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of natures in Chriſt, as made a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and confuſion of natures: That Chriſt did not remain perfect God and perfect man, after this union, but the humane and divine natures were ſo blended together, as to become one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as one Perſon:<note place="margin">

               <p>I ſhall only obſerve that <hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Flavian,</hi> (who was then Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and was afterwards murdered by the <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:93053:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>Faction in the packt Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the Hereſie of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches</hi> from the very Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,<note place="margin">Et ad reſolvendum conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis noſlrae debitum, natura in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violabilis naturae eſt unita paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili, ut quod noſtris remediis congruebat, medlator Dei &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum homo Jeſus chriſtus, &amp; mori poſſet ex uno, &amp; non mori poſſet ex altero. Leo ep. ad Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian.</note> on which I have all along proceeded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it deſtroys the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation by Chriſt. For ſays he, to diſcharge the debt and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our lapſed State; a nature which cannot ſuffer, is united to a nature, which can: That ſo as our Redemption requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Mediator between God and man; the man Chriſt Jeſus might be capable of ſuffering and dying as man, and exempted from all poſſibility of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as God.</p>
               <p>This I think is ſufficient to ſhew, how fundamental the belief of the ſacred Trinity, and the Incarnation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is in the Chriſtian Religion; Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt is a fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or nothing is fundamental in the Chriſtian Faith; and yet the Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt is neceſſarily founded on the belief of the holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, each ſacred Perſon being peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly concerned in the Oeconomy of man's Salvation. And I confeſs, it does mightily confirm me in this way of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:93053:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>the notion of Fundamentals, that it does ſo plainly diſcover the neceſſity of that Faith, which has always been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſacred and inviolable by the Catholick Church: This is the Faith we are baptized into, according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Command, <hi>to baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſum of all the ancient Creeds: The Apoſtles Creed being lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle elſe than the explication of the form of Baptiſm, what we are to believe of God the Father, what of God the Son, and what of God the Holy Ghoſt. And when Hereticks aroſe, who corrupted this Faith, the Catholick Church expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed greater Zeal in nothing, than in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this Faith pure and ſincere: This was the occaſion of the firſt general Councils, wherein <hi>Arius, Neſtorius, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches, Macedonius,</hi> and ſuch other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks were condemned: This occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Nicene, Conſtantinopolitan,</hi> and the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds, which contain only the Catholick expoſition of the Doctrine of the Trinity, in oppoſition to theſe ancient Hereſies. And it would be very ſtrange, if that which is the chief, nay almoſt the only Subject of all
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:93053:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>our Creeds, ſhould not be thought a fundamental of our Religion. And yet it is as ſtrange, that is ſhould be a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, if it be only an abſtruſe and difficult ſpeculation, which is of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe, nor valuable upon any other account than pure Orthodoxy; which is the only reaſon that can be aſſigned, why any men, who believe the Doctrine of the Trinity, ſhould not expreſs a great and warm Zeal for it, becauſe they do not obſerve, how the whole Goſpel-Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt depends on it: The end of Chriſtian Faith is a holy Life, and if men may lead a very holy Life without the velief of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſome think, this Faith cannot be abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation; but now this muſt be a great and dangerous miſtake, though we ſhould ſuppoſe, that men may live very holily without the belief of the Trinity, unleſs we ſuppoſe alſo, that a holy Life will carry men to Heaven without Faith in Chriſt, or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him, for we cannot rightly believe in Chriſt for Salvation without this Faith.</p>
               <p>And thus I might ſhut up the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Fundamentals; for indeed I know nothing ſtrictly fundamental in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:93053:149"/>the Chriſtian Religion, but the Doctrine of the holy Trinity, and the ſeveral Acts and Offices, if I may ſo ſpeak, of each ſacred Perſon in the Oeconomy of man's Salvation, which I have already briefly hinted: But having entred upon a Diſcourſe of ſuch vaſt Importance, to give the greater ſatisfaction to inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive men, I ſhall venture one ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I think no man need go any further.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next inquiry therefore ſhall be, what is fundamental in the Doctrine of Salvation it ſelf. Now this our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour briefly comprehends in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he gave to the Apoſtles, <hi>to preach Repentance and Forgiveneſs of ſins in his Name:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 24.47.</note> i. e. to preach forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins to all true Penitents through Faith in his Name,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.24, 25.</note> or <hi>through Faith in his Blood,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it.</p>
               <p>Now not to diſpute this point at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> all who believe that Chriſt died to make atonement for our ſins, muſt acknowledg the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expiation of Chriſts death to be a fundamental Article of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, whereon the Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt is built: For therefore he is our Saviour, becauſe he ſaves his
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93053:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>People from their ſins, and how this is, we are often told, <hi>viz.</hi> by dying for our ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he may reconcile us to God.</p>
               <p>Now if this be true (as I ſhall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent take for granted) then it muſt be a fundamental Doctrine, upon theſe two accounts; 1. Becauſe the belief or the denial of the atonement of Chriſt's death, makes a ſpecifical change in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. A Religion with a Sacrifice, and a Religion without a Sacrifice differ in the whole kind; the firſt reſpects the atonement of our paſt ſins, and our daily infirmities; it reſpects God, as the Judge and avenger of wickedneſs, as well as the rewarder of thoſe, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſeek him; the other is a kind of Philoſophical inſtitution to train men up in the practice of Piety and Vertue: That is, a Religion without a Sacrifice is at moſt but half as much as a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a Sacrifice; and that half wherein they agree of a quite different nature from each other. That Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which requires an expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to make atonement for ſin, and to obtain the Pardon of it, does alſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyn the practiee of an univerſal Righteouſneſs, which is the whole of a
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93053:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>Religion without a Sacrifice. And yet this practical part of Religion is vaſtly altered by the belief or denial of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and expiation of Chriſt's death.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who deny the death of Chriſt to be an expiatory Sacrifice for the ſins of the World, may pay all that Homage and Worſhip to God, which is due to the great Creator and Benefactor of mankind, and may obſerve all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of moral Righteouſneſs; but there are ſome new Acts of Religious Worſhip, or ſome new inſtances of Duty, or new degrees and reſpects of Vertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2+ letters">
                     <desc>••…</desc>
                  </gap> which neceſſarily reſult from the expiation of Chriſt's death, which either cannot be obſerved at all, or not in their true meaning and ſignification by thoſe who deny it; as to give ſome few inſtances of it.</p>
               <p>The love of God as our Redeemer and Saviour, who gave his own Son for our Ranſom, to die for our ſins, and to make atonement and expiation by his Blood, is very different from the love of God as our Creator, and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, nay as our Redeemer by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Promiſe, and Power; it is a more tranſporting and ſenſible Paſſion, and the peculiar Worſhip of the Goſpel,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93053:151"/>which thoſe cannot give to God, who deny the expiation of Chriſt's death.</p>
               <p>The Worſhip of a God Incarnate, a God in our nature and likeneſs, a God, who is our Saviour, Mediator and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate through his own Blood, vaſtly differs from the Worſhip of a pure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, eternal Spirit, or from the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of an exalted Creature. And this is the peculiar Worſhip of the Lord's Supper, that great and venerable Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Religion, which is a thin and empty Ceremony without it.</p>
               <p>To pray to God in the Name and Mediation of Chriſt, and in vertue of his Sacrifice, vaſtly differs from a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hope and truſt in God's mercy, or in his bare promiſe, or in the Power and Intereſt of a great Favourite, though appointed to be our Mediator, not in vertue of his Sacrifice, but by Royal Favour: Not but that God's Promiſe of Pardon and acceptance confirmed to us by ſuch a powerful Favourite, whom God himſelf hath appointed to be our Advocate, may give us ſufficient ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that God will hear and anſwer our Prayers; but this aſſurance is of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature from the vertue of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and affects our minds in a different
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93053:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>manner, and excites different Paſſions, and very different acts of Devotion, and makes our Worſhip differ as much, as a Mediator by Sacrifice does from a Mediator by Intereſt and Power.</p>
               <p>As for the other parts of Religion, which concern our Converſation with men, or the Government of our own Appetites and Paſſions, there ſeems to be ſome new inſtances, or new degrees of Vertue, which have a neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the Sacrifice of Chriſt's death, as the example or reaſon of them. As that high degree of brotherly love which Chriſt requires of us, as the Badg of our Diſcipleſhip, to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he hath loved us, to forgive one another even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us; all Acts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and charity to our poor Brethren, as knowing the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though he were rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor, that you through his poverty may be rich, the force and prevalency of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and of which reaſon, I think is greatly abated by denying the expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt's death. However I think it is very plain, that the true principle of Goſpel-obedience, that which makes
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93053:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>all our actions in a ſtrict and proper ſence Chriſtian Graces and Vertues, has a neceſſary reſpect to the expiation of Chriſt's death: We muſt cheerfully obey the Will of God, not only conſidered as our Creator, but as a Redeemer; we muſt give up our ſelves to Chriſt, as the purchaſe of his Blood, for <hi>we are not our own, but bought with a price, and therefore muſt glorifie God both with our Bodies, and with our Spirits, which are God's;</hi> we muſt yield our ſelves willing Captives to the conquering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Power of his Love: <hi>the Love of Chriſt constrains us, for we thus judg, that if Chriſt dyed for all, then were all dead, and that he dyed for us, that we who live, might not henceforth live unto our ſelves, but unto him, who dyed for us.</hi> If Chriſt did not redeem and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe us by his Blood, all this ſignifies nothing; it is all but Phraſe, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, and Alluſion, which cannot form a principle of Action: And yet the Apoſtles of Chriſt do not ſo much inſiſt on the Authority of God, as our Maker and Governor, as on his purchaſe as Redeemer, on the love of our dying Lord, who is our Prieſt, our Sacrifice, and Mediator; and were it poſſible to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93053:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>obey the Goſpel without any regard to the redemption of Chriſt, and that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious love of God in it, it were not true Evangelical obedience, no more than it is obedience to God, to do what he commands for ſome private end and reaſon of our own, without any regard to his Authority and Government.</p>
               <p>So that whether the Doctrine of the atonement and ſatisfaction of Chriſt's death be true or falſe, it is certainly fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental either way, either a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Article of Faith, or a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Error, becauſe it alters Foundations, and changes the whole frame of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion. If Chriſt have made atonement and expiation for our ſins, Chriſtianity is one thing, if he have not, it is quite another thing, as different, as it is poſſible; which I think is a plain argument, that the expiation of Chriſt's Blood is a fundamental or foundation. Doctrine, ſince the whole Fabrick of Chriſtian Religion, as it is taught in the Goſpel, is built on it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is one conſideration more, which will confirm this, that the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expiation of Chriſt's death is a fundamental Doctrine, becauſe the Blood of Chriſt, that is, the expiation
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93053:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>of his Blood, is the peculiar object of juſtifying Faith; now certainly that muſt be fundamental, which is eſſential to juſtifying Faith. Salvation or Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Chriſt being the ſum of the Goſpel, whatever is eſſential to juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, is certainly a fundamental Doctrine of Chriſtianity, if there be any ſuch thing as Fundamentals.</p>
               <p>Repentance in its full Extent and Latitude, as it includes not only a ſorrow for our paſt ſins, but the reformation of our lives, and an actual obedience to all the Laws of the Goſpel, is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition of our Pardon and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or neceſſarily required in thoſe, whom God will juſtifie: But Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and a new Life cannot juſtifie us: No Religion, that ever was in the World, taught men certainly to expect Pardon of ſin meerly upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: And it is plain, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind never did; for both Heathens and Jews thought the expiation of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as neceſſary, and more prevalent than meer Repentance, to obtain their Pardon: And the reaſon why God hath appointed us no Sacrifice but a broken heart, or the living Sacrifice of an obedient Soul and Body, to offer to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:93053:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>him, is becauſe he has provided an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifice himſelf, hath given his own Son to be a Sacrifice for us; and the Pardon of our ſins is every where attributed to the death of Chriſt, as the meritorious Cauſe. But then as Chriſt hath dyed for our ſins, and redeemed us with his Blood, and God for Chriſt's ſake will pardon and juſtifie all repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners, ſo we muſt conſider, that meer repentance can no more apply or appropiate the Sacrifice and Expiation of Chriſt's death to us for our Pardon, than it can juſtifie us without a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: That is the peculiar Office of Faith in Chriſt, or Faith in his Blood: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly tells us. <hi>Being justified freely by his Grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.24, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>through the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood.</hi> For though Faith in Chriſt is very often uſed in a very large ſence for the whole Goſpel of our Saviour, and to comprehend all Acts of Obedience and a holy Life, as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from whence they flow, and no other is true juſtifying Faith, but that which includes Obedience and a holy Life: Yet ſometimes Faith is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from Repentance and a holy Life;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93053:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſo has Chriſt, and in a peculiar manner his Blood, for its Object. Thus the ſum of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching was <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 20.21</note> 
                  <hi>and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Christ:</hi> And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles, was,<note place="margin">Luke 24.47.</note> 
                  <hi>to preach Repentance and Remiſſion of ſins in his Name;</hi> that is, through Faith in his Name: So that Faith in Chriſt is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from Repentance in the work of Juſtification; and ſo denotes a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſpect to the expiation of Chriſt's death, as the meritorious Cauſe of Pardon.</p>
               <p>Under the Law, a Sacrifice was avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only for thoſe, for whom it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, but under the Goſpel inſtead of offering a Sacrifice to God, we muſt believe in that Sacrifice, which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy offered, which does particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the merit and vertue of it to our ſelves, as the Oblation of the Sacrifice did under the Law; for if we would have Chriſt for our Saviour, or have any intereſt in the expiation of his death, we muſt chooſe him for our Saviour by Faith in his Blood. For I cannot ſee, but why Repentance may be as well accepted from us without a Sacrifice, as without reſpect and relation to a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93053:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>and yet the only thing, that can entitle our Repentance in particular to the vertue of Chriſt's Sacrifice, is Faith in his Blood, which, I think, is a plain argument, that the atonement of Chriſt's death is a fundamental Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, becauſe it is eſſential to a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith.</p>
               <p>But then there are a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinions relating to the atonement. and ſatisfaction of Chriſt's death, which are true or falſe, but not fundamental: For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves, the Foundation is Chriſt, but yet men may build upon this Foundation either <hi>Gold and Silver, or Hay and Stubble,</hi> that is, true or falſe Doctrines, which are of great uſe in the Chriſtian Life, or of very dangerous conſequence; but yet while they retain the Foundation, though their works pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſuperſtructure of their private Opinions be condemned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, yet they themſelves may eſcape, though with great difficulty, <hi>ſo as by fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus while men heartily believe, that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, and has made expiation for them by his Blood, and expect the Pardon of their ſins only in Chriſt's Name, that is, in vertue of his
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:93053:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sacrifice and Interceſſion, they may fall into great miſtakes about the Nature, Extent, and Application of this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and yet not err Fundamentally, though their Errors may be dangerous, and always are ſo, when they betray them to ſin.</p>
               <p>Of this Nature I reckon ſome of thoſe unhappy Diſputes, which have torn and divided the Church in theſe late days of Liberty and Confuſion, Whether Chriſt bore our ſins, or only the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, whether he were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinner, or only the greateſt Sacrifice for ſin: Whether he ſuffered the ſame Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, which all ſinners ſhould have ſuffered, had they been damned for their ſins, or ſuffered that which was equivalent to it, and which God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a complete and perfect ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Whether the expiation of Chriſt's death was ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the Pardon of our ſins, that God could not forgive ſin without it, or whether God chooſe this way, as moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the wiſe methods of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the moſt glorious Illuſtration of all his Attributes. Whether the death of Chriſt made ſatisfaction to a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vindictive Juſtice, and was paid to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:93053:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>God, as the offended Party, or as the Governor of the World. Whether Chriſt made a general atonement for ſin, or ſatisfied only for the ſins of the Elect; whether all the ſins of the Elect were actually laid upon Chriſt from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and actually pardoned before they were committed, or whether they are pardoned in time, when we repent and believe. Whether what Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, is ſo imputed to us, as if we our ſelves had done it; which makes the greateſt ſinners perfectly Innocent, and looked upon by God, as never to have ſinned, or whether it be imputed to us only for our Pardon and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Whether the active as well as paſſive Obedience of Chriſt be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us for Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like Doctrines, ſome of which are of a very dangerous nature, and a great ſtate of temptation, yet are not fundamental Errors, becauſe they do not deſtroy the Foundation, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement and ſatisfaction of Chriſt's death is acknowledged on all hands, though ſome of theſe Doctrines do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſcure the grace of God, and his ſtupendious wiſdom in the redemption of the World by Jeſus Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:93053:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>muſt be reckon'd as Hay and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble built upon the Foundation, which will prove a great loſs and dammage to ſuch Builders, when every man's work comes to be tryed.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; among the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrines of Salvation by Chriſt, we muſt reckon, not only the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expiation of his death, but the gift of his holy Spirit to renew and ſanctifie us: For this makes him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Saviour, to deliver us from the puniſhment of our ſins, and from the power and dominion of them.</p>
               <p>Now that it is fundamental to the Chriſtian Religion, and to the Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt, to believe the divine influences and aſſiſtances of the holy Spirit to work Faith, and all other Chriſtian graces in us, appears from theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The gift of the holy Spirit is the moſt glorious effect of Chriſt's Power and Interceſſion, and therefore one of the principal fruits and benefits of his Sacrifice; by which we may underſtand the value and neceſſity of it; to deny the interceſſion of Chriſt, whereby he daily diſpenſes and applyes the merits of his Sacrifice, does as much alter the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:93053:156"/>of Salvation by Chriſt, as to deny the atonement of his death, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the aſſiſtances of the divine Spirit, is in effect to deny his Interceſſion, of which the Communications of divine Life and Power is the principal part.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To deny the aſſiſtances of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, turns the Goſpel into a meer external Miniſtration, which makes as fundamental a difference in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, as there is between the Miniſtration of the Letter and of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This in a great meaſure takes away the Office of the holy Spirit in the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of man's Salvation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deſtroyes his Worſhip, which is peculiar to the Chriſtian Religion. The light of nature directs us only to the Worſhip of one God, the Chriſtian Religion conſecrates us at our baptiſm, to the Worſhip of three divine Perſons, and one God. For ſince each ſacred Perſon is peculiarly concerned in the Salvation of ſinners, each of them ought to be acknowledged and adored by us. But whoever denies the efficacy of the holy Spirit in the work of Salvation, deſtroys the foundation of his Worſhip too, conſidered as a diſtinct Perſon in the Trinity.</p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:93053:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="4">4. To deny the aſſiſtances of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, makes the Sacraments of the Chriſtian Religion, meer external Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which were inſtituted as the Miniſtries and Conveyances of Grace, and ſo makes a fundamental change in the Inſtitutions of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nay it makes a fundamental change in the Worſhip of God, and of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. The Chriſtian Worſhip princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally conſiſts, in praiſing God and our Saviour for ſpiritual mercies, in aſcribing the glory of all the good we do to his free Grace, and continual ſuccors, in begging his holy Spirit, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſupplies of Grace, that we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and perſevere in all goodneſs; this we have frequent examples of in the Writings of the Apoſtles; but whoever denies the aſſiſtances of ſupernatural Grace, both defrauds God of his Glory, and himſelf of the benefit and comfort of it. He cannot praiſe God for, nor beg that of God, which he believes, God does not give; which makes our Worſhip very defective, and deprives us of the aſſiſtances of Grace, which we ſhall never have, if we never ask.</p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:93053:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But then all, that I can judge fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental in this point, is, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, progreſs, and perfection of all Chriſtian graces and vertues, are owing to the influences and operations of the holy Spirit. But thoſe other nice diſputes about the manner of the Spirits working in us, whether it be a natural or moral efficacy, whether it be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or efficacious Grace, reſiſtable or irreſiſtable, how the operation of the Spirit is reconcileable with the freedom of humane action; whether the habits of grace be immediately infuſed, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by frequent Acts, theſe I ſay, and ſuch like Diſputes are not fundamental; for though it is of great moment for the government of our lives, which of theſe we believe, yet the Foundation which is the aſſiſtance of the divine Spirit, is ſecured either way, and all that men are to look to is, that they do not entertain ſuch ill notions of God's Grace, as ſhall make them ſecure and careleſs of a holy Life.</p>
               <p>All that I can think neceſſary to add more concerning the Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt, is what I have already ſufficiently hinted, the neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and a holy Life. There are,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:93053:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>I confeſs, a great many dangerous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about this matter, what place Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and a holy Life have in the juſtification of a ſinner. And though it is of very great moment to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this matter rightly, and as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly as we can, for fear of that ill influence which ſuch miſtakes may have upon our lives, and too apparently have upon the lives of many profeſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; yet I cannot think, that man errs fundamentally, who believes, that God will juſtifie and pardon none but true penitent and reformed ſinners, and that not for the ſake and merit of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and good Works, but for the ſake of Chriſt, and through Faith in his Blood, though he may differ about the neceſſity of Repentance and Obedience, and what place it has in the juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſinner. Whether it be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Condition, or a neceſſary requiſite and Qualification, or a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant and effect of Juſtification, or whether it be neceſſary only to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but not to our Juſtification: Whether Faith juſtifie as an Inſtrument, or as a Condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For while Faith in Chriſt and Obedience to his Laws are both ſecured, without either dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:93053:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>from the Grace of God, or the Purity of the Chriſtian Religion, other miſtakes, though dangerous, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued to their juſt Conſequences, and when men own, and live by ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, yet I hope, are very harmleſs and Innocent, when they do not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt mens lives, nor hinder the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the divine Grace.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given an Eſſay (and I hope it may paſs for an Eſſay) towards the Diſcovery, what are fundamental Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion. I have ſtrictly confined my ſelf to the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Chriſtianity, though there are ſome principles of natural Religion, which are antecedently neceſſary to be believed, but they are more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known and agreed in. I have had a tender regard to the weakneſſes and miſtakes of mankind, and to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of Catholick Communion, and therefore have, as far as was conſiſtent with preſerving the eſſentials of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, caſt moſt of our modern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies out of the number of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals; which, if carefully conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would aſſwage that intemperate heat, with which they are managed, and more eaſily reconcile our differences;
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:93053:159"/>and yet I have not rejected any Doctrine out of the number of Fundamentals, which was ever defined to be ſuch by any received general Council of the Chriſtian Church; which gives me ſome hope, that I am come pretty near the mark.</p>
               <p>But to give ſome new light to this matter, and to prevent ſuch objections, as I can foreſee, there are ſome few things, which I ſhall further obſerve, before I proceed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt concerns the judgment of that truly great and learned Perſon Mr. <hi>Joſeph Mede.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s works. Epiſt. 84 to Mr. <hi>Hartlib.</hi>
                  </note> He ſeems indeed to reject this way of ſtating the <hi>Ratio</hi> of Fundamentals, in relation to ſome one great Fundamental Doctrine, as I have now done. For in his cenſure of Mr. <hi>Streſo</hi>'s Book of Fundamentals (which I have never yet ſeen) he obſerves, that he makes three ſorts of Fundamentals. The firſt <hi>is the Fundamentum ipſum,</hi> or the Foundation it ſelf, though what that is, he does not tell us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how far I agree with Mr. <hi>Streſo</hi> in that, I know not. <hi>The other two he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by their relation to it, either</hi> à parte ante, <hi>and ſuch he terms</hi> ſub Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales, (which by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s cenſure I
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93053:159"/>perceive, did not ſtrictly belong to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but either to the principles of natural Religion, or the Jewiſh State) <hi>or à parte poſt, which may be called</hi> ſuper Fundamentales, <hi>which he makes ſuch as are by immediate and neceſſary conſequence deducible from the</hi> Fundamentum ſalutis, where he obſerves, that he had inſerted ſome Doctrines of pure ſpeculation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Fundamentals, which I confeſs to be a great fault: But from this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect account of Mr. <hi>Streſo's</hi> notion, I cannot gueſs, how far my way might fall under the ſame cenſure. As for thoſe two faults, he has obſerved in Mr. <hi>Streſo</hi>'s way, <hi>viz.</hi> reckoning ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines among the Fundamentals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, as are not ſtrictly Chriſtian Doctrines, or are matters of meer ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, I have carefully avoided them both; and as for judging what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Doctrines are fundamental to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, from ſome general comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Fundamental, which contains the ſum of Chriſtian Religion, that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt demonſtrative way that can be: For though I do not like the way of making fundamental Articles by deduction and conſequence from ſuch a Fundamental, becauſe as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:93053:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>obſerves, all men may not ſee the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuch a conſequence, though it appear plain and evident to others; yet if for inſtance, the Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt be the great funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrine of the Goſpel (and if that be not Fundamental, I am ſure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is) then though every true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from this Doctrine be not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, yet whatever is neceſſarily included in this Doctrine, without which we cannot rightly underſtand and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Salvation by Chriſt, muſt be as Fundamental, as the Doctrine it ſelf is, unleſs the Letters or Words of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle be Fundamental, but not the true ſence of it; and within theſe bounds I have kept my ſelf; I have aſſerted no Doctrine to be Fundamental, but what is neceſſary to our belief of Salvation by Chriſt, which is a very different thing from drawing fundamental conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> indeed aſſigns another <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> of fundamental Articles;<note place="margin">Ib. ep. 83.</note> in general that they be <hi>neceſſarii cognitu &amp; credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu ad ſalutem,</hi> neceſſary to be known and to be believed to Salvation <hi>ſimply and abſolutely, and therefore no Chriſtian which ſhall be ſaved, uncapable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:93053:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>them;</hi> which exactly agrees with me, who make only the Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt in its true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification a fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
               <p>But then more particularly he tells us, <hi>that they must not be ſuch truths, as are meerly ſpeculative, and contained only in the understanding, but of ſuch only as have a neceſſary influence upon practiſe, and not all thoſe neither, but ſuch as have neceſſary influence upon the Acts and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Christian Life, or whereon the Acts, without which a Chriſtian lives not, depend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such namely, as without the knowledg and belief whereof, we can neither invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Father aright, nor have that Faith and relyance upon him, and his Son our Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to remiſſion of ſins, and the hope of the Life to come.</hi> Where he ſeems evidently to confine Fundamentals to the Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt, for nothing elſe is neceſſary to what he calls the proper acts and functions of the Chriſtian Life. But he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:93053:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>How far this</hi> ratio <hi>of a Fundamental Article will ſtretch, I know not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will fetch in moſt of the Articles of the Apostles Creed; and by it alſo thoſe two main errors of the</hi> Socinians, <hi>the one denying the divine Nature, the other the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, may be diſcerned to be Fundamental; for without the belief of the firſt, the Divine Majesty cannot be rightly, that is, incommunicably wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd, ſo as to have no other Gods beſides him. For he that believes not Chriſt to be conſubſtantial to the Father, and yet honours him with the ſame Worſhip, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips not the Father incommunicably, which is the</hi> formalis ratio <hi>of the Worſhip of the true God, from whom we look for eternal Life; and without the belief of the ſecond, the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, there can be, I ſuppoſe, no ſaving Faith nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance on Chriſt for the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> How well this agrees, with what I have diſcours'd about Fundamentals, every one will eaſily perceive.</p>
               <p>Some other learned men go the ſame way with Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> in aſſigning the general <hi>Ratio</hi> or Notion of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, that they are ſuch Doctrines, as have a great influence upon a Chriſtian Life, though they do not confine it, as
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93053:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>he does, to ſome peculiar acts of the Chriſtian Life, and he could have no reaſon to do ſo, had he not ſome other Notion of Fundamentals in his mind, than what he expreſſed, for all the acts of Piety and Vertue are equally requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us by the Laws of the Goſpel, and therefore it is moſt reaſonable in this way, to extend the Notion of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals to all thoſe Doctrines, which have an univerſal influence upon a good Life; but I have ſomething to offer with all modeſty, and juſt reſpect and deference to ſuch great names againſt this Notion of Fundamentals.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a holy Life is not the only deſign of the Chriſtian Religion, and therefore if we will judge of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrines by the end, they are intended to ſerve, we muſt take in the whole and entire end of the Chriſtian Religion, which is forgiveneſs of ſins, as well as holyneſs of Life: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever is neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the forgiveneſs of ſins is a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Doctrine of Chriſtianity, though we could not ſee, what direct and immediate influence it has upon the reformation of our Lives.</p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:93053:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. The Doctrine of the ever bleſſed Trinity, hath in all ages of the Church been accounted a fundamental Article, and yet nothing is more plain, than that the belief of three divine Perſons, conſidered only as three Perſons, has no greater force in it to make men good, than the belief of one ſupreme and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God. It is true, when we conſider all theſe divine Perſons as concerned in the Oeconomy of Man's Salvation; ſo the belief of each Perſon has a diſtinct and powerful influence upon our minds, but this is not owing immediately to the Doctrine of the Trinity, but to the Doctrine of man's Salvation by Chriſt, who was ſent into the World by his Father, to accompliſh the Work of our redemption, and when he left the World, ſent his holy Spirit to abide with us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All thoſe Doctrines, which have a powerful influence upon a good life, are not in a ſtrict and proper ſence Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrines, much leſs fundamental Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and therefore this can be no good Criterion of a Fundamental; ſuch are all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural arguments to Religion and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Life, which though they be adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:93053:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>into Chriſtianity, yet will hardly paſs for fundamentals of Chriſtianity with any man, who can diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween natural knowledg and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Men may live very holy lives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledg or belief of many Doctrines, which are excellently fitted to promote holineſs, and therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doctrine, which will advance holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is not Fundamental, and yet this general rule does not direct us, how to diſtinguiſh them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nay, many Doctrines, which are ſo far from being Fundamental, that they are falſe, may yet prevail with, and encline ſome men to the practiſe of real holineſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some Doctrines, which naturally tend to debauch mens lives, are not yet fundamental Errors, for men may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them and yet live well; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall ſtill want a Rule to judg of fundamental Hereſies by, unleſs no Hereſie be Fundamental, but when it debauches mens lives, and by the ſame rule, no Doctrine is Fundamental, but when it actually governs and reforms our lives.</p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:93053:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="7">7. This leaves men at great liberty to believe what Doctrines they pleaſe to be Fundamental, and to change even Chriſtianity it ſelf into a new Religion; for if they think they can obey God without ſuch Doctrines, nay without the belief of Chriſtianity it ſelf, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, why they ſhould believe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity it ſelf to be a fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I readily grant, that no Doctrine can be a fundamental Article of Faith, which has not one way or other an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon a Chriſtian life. But then all the peculiar Arguments of the Goſpel, all the principles of pure evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience, as well as all the Fundamentals of Faith, are contained in the Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt. That it ſelf is the great motive of the Goſpel, and every part and branch of it is big with arguments and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives to Vertue. Take away the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation, and no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration can have any force; and there needs no other Arguments to a Chriſtian, nay, there are no other Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Motives, but what are contained in it. Whatever is eſſential to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation, is a Fundamental
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:93053:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>Article and a powerful Motive of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and nothing elſe is either. So that there is no ſuch certain way to diſcern Fundamentals, though they were to be tryed by their tendency to promote real Righteouſneſs, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what is eſſential to the Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt, which is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Fundamental, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it all the principles of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deſire, it may be further obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that when I diſcourſe of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, I do not reject all other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines beſides what are ſtrictly Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, as uſeleſs in the Chriſtian Life, or unfit terms of Church Communion. God affords us more than what is bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, for our ſpiritual, as well as for our natural life; and expects from us, that we ſhould make daily improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Knowledg and Vertue: And if this be the duty of private Chriſtians, it is much more the duty of particular Churches to arrive at the greateſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Knowledg, and to inſtruct her Children, not only in thoſe Doctrines, which are abſolutely neceſſary to the being of Chriſtianity, but in all thoſe great truths, which advance our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:93053:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the Chriſtian Life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no doubt, but every Church has Authority over her own Members, to require, as the terms of Communion, an explicite aſſent to many great and uſeful truths, and an abrenunciation of many dangerous Errors, which are not in a ſtrict ſence Fundamental; or elſe ſhe has no Authority to teach the whole mind and will of God, nor to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the purity of Chriſtian Doctrine: For there are many Doctrines of vaſt uſe in the Chriſtian Life, and many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fatal and pernicious Errors, which are not properly Fundamental, and yet it may be, have occaſioned the final Damnation of many more, than ever fundamental Errors have done. And if the Church be bound to take care of mens Souls, ſhe is bound alſo to root out ſuch pernicious Doctrines. But the uſe I deſigned the Doctrine of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals for in this place, is the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Catholick Communion between diſtinct Churches, which have no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority over each other: For though a Church have entertained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corrupt and dangerous Doctrines, yet if ſhe profeſs to believe all the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Chriſtian Faith, we have
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:93053:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>no Authority upon the account of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to divide from her Communion: We muſt not indeed communicate in her Errors, though not Fundamental, and no Church, but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> impoſes ſuch hard terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion upon other Churches, but while ſhe retains all the eſſentials of Chriſtian Faith, ſhe is ſo far a true Church; and if there be nothing to hinder it, may and ought to be received into Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When I aſſert, that ſuch and ſuch Doctrines are Fundamental, by Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals I underſtand the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Knowledg, without which, no man can underſtand and believe like a Chriſtian, which plainly proves, that they are neceſſary to the very being of a Chriſtian Church, and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Catholick Communion: Which is all I am concerned to prove.</p>
               <p>But if any man ſhould put hard Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to me with reſpect to the final Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of particular Chriſtians, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how far the explicite knowledg and belief of Fundamentals is neceſſary to Salvation: What ſhall become of ſo many Chriſtians as are guilty of groſs ignorance for want of good Inſtruction,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:93053:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſcarce underſtand any thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly of the Chriſtian Religion? or what ſhall become of thoſe, who through the prejudices and prepoſſeſſions of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, deny any fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Chriſtian Faith, as the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt, or his ſatisfaction for ſins, and yet are otherwiſe very pious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, and uſeful men? I ſay, I do not think my ſelf bound to anſwer theſe Queſtions, nor to ſearch into the ſecret Counſels of God, to determine how he will judge the World, or what allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances he will make in ſome favourable Caſes; but yet I have ſome few things to offer, which poſſibly may give ſome ſatisfaction to modeſt Inquirers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt not deny the neceſſity of Chriſtian Faith and Knowledg for the ſake of any difficult Caſes; for that is to deny the neceſſity of Chriſtianity it ſelf, or of Faith in Chriſt, to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners; and thus our Charity to other men will make us our ſelves the greateſt Hereticks of all. And if any part of Chriſtian Faith and Knowledg is neceſſary to Salvation, certainly the knowledg and belief of Fundamentals is, which are therefore commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by this Character, <hi>the knowledg
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:93053:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>and belief of which is neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And if Infidelity be a damning ſin, why ſhould not a fundamental Hereſie be ſo, which is infidelity with reſpect to ſome eſſential and ſaving Doctrine of Chriſtianity, and in its conſequence overthrows ſome material and eſſential part of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a vaſt difference between the Caſe of thoſe men, who for want of good Inſtruction, have not an explicite underſtanding of the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Faith, and of thoſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any Fundamental. As for the firſt, a very little indiſtinct knowledg of Chriſt, if it govern their lives, and teach them to live in Obedience to their Saviour, will carry them ſafely to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for God requires little of thoſe to whom little is given. Now there is no man, that deſerves the name of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who has not learnt his Creed, who does not know and believe, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to die for ſin, and to ſave ſinners, and that God for Chriſt's ſake will forgive our ſins, if we repent of them, and live a new life; now ſuch a general knowledg as this, without any fundamental Error to ſpoil the vertue and efficacy of it, may
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:93053:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſuffice to produce all thoſe Acts of a Chriſtian life, which are abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a ſtate of Salvation, ſuch as Repentance from dead works, and a truſt and affiance in God through the Blood of Chriſt for forgiveneſs of ſins. The Thief upon the Croſs cannot well be ſuppoſed to have known ſo much, and the Jewiſh Converts, who embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Faith upon St. <hi>Peters</hi> preaching to them, and were immediately baptized in great numbers, cannot be ſuppoſed at that time to know more; and yet this was accepted from them at that time, and in that ſtate of things, and by the ſame reaſon will be accepted from thoſe, who want the opportunities of better inſtruction: And if there be any baptized and nominal Chriſtians, who do not know thus much, it is a great ſcandal to the Chriſtian Church, but I know not, how we are more concerned for their Salvation, than for Pagans and Infidels.</p>
               <p>But as for thoſe, who deny any fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Article, they are got above this ſtate of a general and implicite Faith in Chriſt, and err not for want of inſtruction, but from a certain wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and pride of underſtanding.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:93053:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>They inquire into the particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Faith, and underſtand, what has been, and is, the general Faith of Chriſtians in ſuch matters, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would have no occaſion to deny ſuch Catholick Doctrines; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, they have a great conceit and confidence of their own knowledg, that they dare oppoſe their private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reaſonings againſt the declared ſence of the univerſal Church, which is ſuch unpardonable immodeſty, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no excuſe, if they loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Mazes and Labyrinths of their own making, and miſtake their way to Heaven. And though ſuch Perſons may be otherwiſe very pious and uſeful men, yet I do not ſee, why we ſhould deny the neceſſity of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Faith any more for their ſakes, than for the ſake of devout and vertuous Jews and Heathens.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Having thus, as plainly as I can, ſtated and notion of Fundamentals, the next inquiry is concerning thoſe Churches, which profeſſedly own all the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and yet together with the belief of all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals entertain ſuch corrupt Doctrines,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:93053:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>as in their immediate and neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences overthrow Foundations, and whether ſuch Churches may be ſaid to err Fundamentally.</p>
               <p>I will but briefly touch on this head, and though I might give too many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, I ſhall at preſent confine my ſelf to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I know no fundamental Article of our Faith, that is expreſly denyed by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> She receives all the ancient Creeds, profeſſes the Faith of the holy Trinity, the Incarnation, the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt's death, his Interceſſion for us at the right hand of God, but then ſhe teaches ſuch other corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as all the wit of man cannot reconcile with this Faith: As to ſhew this briefly with reference to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and interceſſion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine of Chriſt's ſatisfaction ſeems many ways to be overthrown by the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> As by the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifice of the Maſs, which is offered for the quick and for the dead: For if Chriſt made a perfect ſatisfaction for ſin by his death upon the Croſs, what need of repeating this Sacrifice every day, which repreſents the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, to be as imperfect as the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:93053:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sacrifices of the Law, which could not take away ſin, nor make the comers thereunto perfect, and therefore were repeated again every year. Thus the Doctrine of humane Penances and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, eſpecially the fire of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the merits of good Works, and the ſuperabundant merits of ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints, which compoſe the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the Church, and may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope to other ſinners to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their Pardon, which is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Doctrine of indulgences, ſeem mightily to diſparage the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, for if he have made a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect atonement for all our ſins, we need not invent ſo many other ways of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>And whoever conſiders what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches about the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Saints and Angels and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> could hardly think that ſhe did believe, that there is but one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But I need not enumerate many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, the truth of this being too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and notorious: The great Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then is this, whether ſuch a Church may be ſaid to be guilty of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:93053:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>Errors; for this ſounds like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that a Church which believes all the fundamental Articles of that Chriſtian Faith, ſhould yet be guilty of fundamental Errors. And indeed if by fundamental Errors, we mean ſuch Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors as deny any fundamental Article, ſo it is plain, that a Church which owns and profeſſes all Fundamentals, cannot be guilty of fundamental Errors, but if by fundamental Errors, we mean ſuch Errors, as contradict the Fundamentals of Faith, ſo ſhe may be guilty of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Errors, becauſe it is poſſible for a Church to believe two Doctrines, which contradict each other, when the Contradiction is not in expreſs terms, but conſequential: For all men or Churches do not ſee, or will not own the immediate and neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of their own Doctrine; as may eaſily be obſerved among a great many other men beſides thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the uſe of this obſervation is very conſiderable upon many accounts, but eſpecially in our preſent Diſpute about Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as will appear by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:93053:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="3">3. How far and in what Caſes we may communicate with ſuch a Church, as believes all the Fundamentals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, and yet teaches ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as in their immediate and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequences overthrow Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. This is a very material diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a Church, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies any fundamental Article of Faith, and a Church, which believes all Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, but ſuperadds ſome corrupt Doctrines, which in their Conſequences deſtroy Foundations; that the firſt is never capable of Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe ſhe denies Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is the neceſſary condition of Catholick Communion; but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in ſome caſes may be, becauſe ſhe retains all ſaving knowledg, <hi>i. e.</hi> all which is of abſolute neceſſity to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though intermixt with dangerous Errors. Now to ſtate this matter, how far we may communicate with ſuch a Church as profeſſes all the fundamental Articles of Faith, but yet ſuperadds o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very corrupt and dangerous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, we may conſider theſe two things.</p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:93053:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="1">1. I think, I need not tell any man, that we muſt not purchaſe the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſuch a Church, by profeſſing our Aſſent to any corrupt Doctrine, though it be not a fundamental Error. No one Church ought thus to impoſe upon another, nor does any Church pretend to it, but only the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Every Church is bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her own Faith, as pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as ſhe can; but ſhe has not that Authority over any other Church, as to impoſe upon their Faith. An or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church may and ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh neighbour Churches of any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Corruptions, but muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their Communion for every Error, though of dangerous Conſequence, if it be not Fundamental. The belief of all fundamental Articles of Faith, does mightily qualifie the evil and malignant influence of many very corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; which is the true reaſon, why many men are obſerved to live much better than they believe, becauſe, though they have entertained a great many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Doctrines, which in their natural Conſequences are very apt to tempt men to ſin, and to encourage them in it; yet, when withal they heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93053:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>all the fundamental Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith, this true Faith is ſo directly contrary to the ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Errors, that they do not ſee the ill conſequences of ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, or are ſufficiently antidoted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the poyſon of them; nay many times it ſo happens, that men are ſo far from ſeeing the ill Conſequences of their Doctrines, that they draw only good Conſequences from them, which may make them as good or better men, than many are, who have a better Faith.</p>
               <p>Thus to inſtance at preſent in ſome very popular and prevailing Doctrines, not diſputing whether they be true or falſe. The Doctrine of abſolute Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reprobation, the Inconditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of the Covenant of Grace, the no-neceſſity of holineſs to our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the abſolute impotency of humane nature to do the leaſt good, the irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtibility of the divine Grace, and ſuch like Antinomian Doctrines, are charged by their Adverſaries with as diſmal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, as any Doctrines are capable of, even to the overthrow of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and I doubt not but have very ill effects upon mens minds, who are not throughly poſſeſt with ſome other
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:93053:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>Principles to qualifie and allay them. But yet if after all this, theſe men do firmly believe the infinite goodneſs and juſtice of God, the inflexible holineſs and purity of his nature, his irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable enmity to all ſin, and that they ſhall never go to Heaven without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, it is impoſſible, they ſhould make any ill uſe of theſe Doctrines to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage themſelves in ſin; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, if they believe, right or wrong, that theſe Doctrines do mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advance the grace of God in the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſinners, it may increaſe their love to God, inflame their Devotions; and make them very active in all holy obedience. For when men are poſſeſt with a prevailing ſence of the grace and love of God and our Saviour, they may ſpare a great many other arguments to obedience.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt not hence infer, that it is indifferent, whether men believe right or wrong, for every practical Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is a ſtate of Temptation, and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Doctrines do oftner hinder the efficacy of an orthodox Faith, than an orthodox Faith prevents the miſchief of an erroneous perſwaſion, as is lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſeen in the lives of too many men:
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:93053:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>But the only inference I draw from hence is this, that every Error, though in it ſelf of dangerous conſequence, is not a ſufficient reaſon to deny Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to ſuch a Church, as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch Errors, profeſſes all the fundamental Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, if we can maintain Communion with her without profeſſing her Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. While the fundamental Doctrines of Faith are ſecure, no corrupt Doctrines are a ſufficient reaſon to break Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which do not corrupt the Chriſtian Worſhip. The principal Acts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion conſiſt in Chriſtian Worſhip; and if any Church have ſo corrupted divine Worſhip, that a good Chriſtian muſt not joyn in it, we muſt of neceſſity abſtain from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, though we are not equally bound to deny them ours. For there are ſome Fundamentals of Worſhip, as well as Faith, as the Worſhip of one God, through one Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, and when any Church corrupts the Worſhip of God in its vital and eſſential parts, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does in the Worſhip of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and Images,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:93053:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>and the conſecrated Hoſt, it is neceſſary then to withdraw our ſelves from ſuch a corrupt Communion.</p>
               <p>But then as for thoſe Doctrines, which though they may be corrupt and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are neither fundamental Errors, nor introduce any ſuch fundamental Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions into religious Worſhip; I can ſee no imaginable reaſon, why they ſhould break Communion between neighbour Churches; if no Churches muſt communicate with each other, which do not exactly agree in all the Diſputes and Controverſies of Religion, it will be hard to find any two Churches in the World, that can maintain this Chriſtian Communion. Certainly, Catholick Communion requires us to communicate with all thoſe Churches, with whom we can communicate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; and therefore when a Church denies no fundamental Article of Faith, nor corrupts the Chriſtian Worſhip in any fundamental and eſſential part of it, nor requires us to believe any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which we believe to be erroneous, as the neceſſary terms of Communion with her, that is, when we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with her without doing any thing that is evil, nothing can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93053:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>our breach of Communion.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance, I take the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrine of Conſubſtantiation to be a very great Error, and if they ſhould deny Communion to me, unleſs I would profeſs my belief of it, I ſhould judge it a ſufficient reaſon to withdraw Communion from them; yet if no ſuch Condition be impoſed on me, I would make no ſcruple to communicate with them, becauſe, though Conſubſtantiation be an Error, yet it does not corrupt their Worſhip, as the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation does the Worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches obſerve the Inſtitution of our Saviour, without any Idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Hoſt, their Doctrine makes no change in their Worſhip, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can be no reaſon to withdraw our Communion. The Errors of any Church cannot make its Communion ſinful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they make its Worſhip ſo. Were Tranſubſtantiation it ſelf (as abſurd a Doctrine, as it is) a meer ſpeculation, without any influence upon Worſhip, did the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Inſtitutions of our Saviour in celebrating the Lord's Supper, without either taking from it, or adding a new
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:93053:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>Idolatrous Worſhip to it, they might enjoy their Opinion, if they pleaſed, ſo they would let me enjoy mine, and I would not break with them meerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſcore.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be vainer, than to dream of reconciling all the Diſputes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, and of making all men or all Churches of a mind in every thing, and if Catholick Communion cannot be maintained among Churches of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent belief and perſwaſion in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted points, we muſt never hope for any ſuch thing: And if it may be, our only Inquiry is, what difference and variety of Opinions is conſiſtent with Catholick Communion; and I know no other anſwer to it but this, that we may ſafely communicate with any Church, how different ſoever our Opinions in other matters may be, while we agree in all the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Faith, and Eſſentials of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>Thoſe animoſities indeed, which the heats of diſputation occaſion too often, not only between private men, but Chriſtian Churches, ſet them at a much greater diſtance from each other, than the moſt diſtant Opinions; but yet that
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:93053:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>this is practicable, to maintain Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Communion notwithſtanding this variety of Opinions, is evident, not only from the intrinſick reaſon of the thing, but from manifeſt experience.</p>
               <p>We know how many Sects there were in the Jewiſh Church, eſpecially thoſe two famous Sects of the Phariſees and Sadduces, and yet they lived in the Communion of the ſame Church, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the ſame Sacrifices, worſhipped God at the ſame Temple, and obſerved the ſame Rites and Ceremonies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and confined their Diſputes to their ſeveral Schools.</p>
               <p>The Jewiſh and the Heathen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts in the time of the Apoſtles differed about a very material point, the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s exhortation and command, they lived in the Communion of the ſame Church, and in the joynt exerciſe of all the Acts of Chriſtian Worſhip,<note place="margin">Defence, p. 443. &amp;c.</note> as I diſcours'd at large in the Defence.</p>
               <p>How many different Opinions are there among the Doctors and Churches of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans, Dominicans, Jeſuits?</hi> The ſame points are diſputed among them,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:93053:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>and that with as great warmth and keenneſs, as there are between the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and abundance more. Nay, the <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches differ upon thoſe great points of Infallibility, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Jurisdiction of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet all live in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſame Church. And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, but that all the Chriſtian Churches in the World, excepting the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> might maintain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion upon as eaſie terms.</p>
               <p>The breaches between the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Churches have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times compoſed, eſpecially between the <hi>Polonian</hi> Churches; an account of which we have at large in <hi>Pareus</hi> his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> which is a plain argument, that it is not meerly the difference of Opinions, but the diſtempers of mens minds, if ſuch agreement and concord be not perpetual; ſo that no doctrinal Diſputes ought to divide the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Chriſtian Church, but ſuch as ſubvert the foundations of our Faith, or corrupt the eſſentials of Chriſtian Worſhip, and this may ſuffice for the firſt inquiry, what are the terms of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:93053:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>Communion with reſpect to Doctrines, from which it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Catholick Communion is neither in its ſelf an impracticable noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the practiſe of it very difficult to all good Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is time now to conſider the next Inquiry, what are the neceſſary terms of Catholick Communion, with reſpect to Church-government. And the only Queſtion I ſhall endeavour to reſolve under this Head, is this. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in what Caſes, it is lawful to communicate with a Church, which is not governed by Biſhops, nor by Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, who were ordained by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this Inquiry is plainly this. It is ſufficiently known, that there are ſeveral Proteſtant Churches of great note, governed without Biſhops, by a Colledge of Presbyters, who have no other Orders, but what they received from Presbyters. Now if Epiſcopacy be ſo eſſential to the Conſtitution of a Church, that we muſt not own any Church which has no Biſhops, we muſt renounce the Communion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> and ſome others, which is
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:93053:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>both a very invidious and uncharitable thing, and a great injury to the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Profeſſion, and does mightily ſtreighten Catholick Communion. If Epiſcopacy be not ſo eſſential to the Conſtitution of a Church, but that we may communicate with thoſe Churches which have no Biſhops, why do we, reject our Diſſenters at home, and condemn them of Schiſm, for rejecting the Epiſcopal Authority, and forming themſelves into Church-ſocieties without Biſhops? Why are we not as kind to our own Friends, Neighbours, and Countrey-men, as we are to Foreign Churches?</p>
               <p>Now though the Church of <hi>England</hi> has always aſſerted the Authority of Biſhops, and condemned thoſe of her own Communion, who have ſeparated from their Biſhops, yet ſhe has been ſo far from condemning Foreign reformed Churches for the want of Biſhops, that ſhe has always lived in Communion with them, and defended them againſt their accuſers; and I reſolve to ſteer by this Compaſs, ſo to vindicate the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, as neither to injure the Epiſcopal Authority, nor to juſtifie our Schiſms at home. And to do this
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:93053:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>with all poſſible plainneſs, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by theſe ſteps.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I obſerve, there is a vaſt difference between ſeparating from Epiſcopal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, where Epiſcopacy is the ſetled Government of the Church, and living without Epiſcopal Government, where we cannot have it; which makes a great difference between our Diſſenters, and ſome Foreign Churches. Some of the Foreign Proteſtant Churches indeed have no Proteſtant Biſhops, nor ever had, and it may be, could not have; but Epiſcopacy has been the eſtabliſht Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ever ſince the Reformation; and for any Chriſtians to ſeparate from their Biſhops, was always accounted Schiſm by the Chriſtian Church, unleſs there were ſome very neceſſary reaſons to juſtifie ſuch a Separation; but in ſome caſes not to have Biſhops may be no Schiſm.</p>
               <p>If any man ſhould object, that the Caſe of our Diſſenters, and the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches is the very ſame; for the Foreign Churches had Biſhops alſo of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, but ſeparated from them, upon account of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Corruptions, which made their
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93053:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>Communion unlawful, and many of them ſet up no Biſhops of their own; and thus our Diſſenters ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and her Biſhops, upon account of the corruptions in her Worſhip, and are as excuſable as the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant Churches, for ſetting up a Government without Biſhops; I anſwer. Not to take notice now, what a vaſt difference there is between ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> there is one very obvious difference in this very matter, which takes off the whole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. For our Diſſenters make Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Epiſcopacy to be one reaſon of their Separation, which no reformed Church ever did before: The Reformed Churches abroad ſeparated from Popiſh Biſhops, our Diſſenters ſeparate from Epiſcopacy it ſelf.</p>
               <p>All the reformed Churches abroad owned Epiſcopacy, though they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned Popiſh Biſhops; ſeveral of them retain both the name and thing, as the Churches of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Denmark:</hi> Others retain the Office, though they have changed the name; as ſeveral <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Churches, which have their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents, <hi>Generales</hi> and <hi>Generaliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimi,</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:93053:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>who anſwer to our Biſhops and Arch-biſhops; and as for thoſe Churches which have them not, they never reject Epiſcopal Communion, but all of them have owned Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> reverenced our Biſhops, highly commended the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Church, cenſured and condemned our Schiſmaticks, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their judgments in favour of Epiſcopacy, and wiſhed the reſtitution of it, and the moſt ſome of their moſt learned men have pretended to, was only to juſtifie the Lawfulneſs of a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian parity.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Durel</hi>'s Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Saywell</hi>'s Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Catholick Unity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 228, &amp;c.</note> It were eaſie here to fill up ſeveral Pages with the judgment of the moſt famous Divines abroad, but this has been ſo often done by others, and very lately by Dr. <hi>Saywell,</hi> that I ſhall refer my Readers to them for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this point. And is not this a very material difference between our Diſſenters, and the reformed Churches abroad, which have not Epiſcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? Our Diſſenters ſeparate from Epiſcopacy, which they own; from our reformed Biſhops, which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Communion with, and therefore are as well Separatiſts from the reformed Presbyterian Churches, as from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:93053:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. As it is Schiſm without abſolute neceſſity to caſt off the Authority of our Biſhops, and to ſeparate from them, ſo it is much more ſo to reject Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Communion and the Government of Biſhops, as unlawful and Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; which makes a very material dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between our Diſſenters, and thoſe reformed Churches abroad, who have no Biſhops of their own.</p>
               <p>There is nothing our Diſſenters more vehemently oppoſe than Epiſcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for which, they never think, they can find names bad enough: Not to mention others at preſent, this is the great deſign of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s late Hiſtory of Epiſcopacy, to prove, that Dioceſan Epiſcopacy in the very Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it, overthrows the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's Inſtitution: This is his great deſign in his Abridgement of Church-Hiſtory, to beſpatter and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the moſt renowned Biſhops of the Church, to reproach all their Actions, to charge them with all the Hereſies and Schiſms, which have diſturbed the Church, and to paint them in ſuch frightful ſhapes, that all Chriſtians may flie from them as the great troublers of our <hi>Iſrael:</hi> I cannot imagine, what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:93053:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>he could think to do by this to common Chriſtianity, which is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in nothing more, than in the Credit and Reputation of the chief Miniſters of Religion, but I muſt acknowledge, all this was admirably calculated to ſerve a Faction.</p>
               <p>But the Foreign Churches, which have no Biſhops, do not condemn E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, nor ſeparate from it, as an unlawful Communion, and whoever does ſo, is a Schiſmatick from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. This is ſo plain, that there needs no proof of it. For let men talk never ſo ill of Biſhops, and their Government, the matter of fact is evident, that the Church of Chriſt has for many hundred years had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Government, than that of Biſhops. They can ſhew no Church till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which was governed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Biſhops; even ſuch Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; as our Diſſenters now vent their Spleen againſt. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> indeed and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would gladly except the two firſt Centuries, but what little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they have for it, has been already examined in the Defence; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they are all forc'd to acknowledg, that in the ſucceeding Ages of the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:93053:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>Church till the Reformation, which was above twelve hundred years, the Church was governed by Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as it is at this day; ſo that by renouncing the Epiſcopal Communion of the Church in our Age, they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the whole Catholick Church for ſo many hundred years. As far as Epiſcopal Government is concerned, they condemn the whole Catholick Church in their ſeparation from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as governed by Dioceſan Biſhops; nay herein they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate alſo from all the reformed Churches, who hold Communion with the Epiſcopal Church of <hi>England;</hi> and if this be not enough to prove them Schiſmaticks, there is no ſuch thing as Schiſm from the Church; for there was no Church for near fifteen hundred years, nor is there at this day, which they can communicate with upon theſe Principles, but their own beloved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles; for it has always been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as unlawful, to communicate with ſuch a Church, as communicates with another Church, whoſe Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is ſinful, as it is to communicate with ſuch a Church our ſelves, and it muſt be ſo according to the Principles
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:93053:177"/>of Catholick Communion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be unlawful to communicate with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Biſhops, it muſt be unlawful alſo to communicate with thoſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Presbyterian Churches, which communicate with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, I ſuppoſe, may ſatisfie any man, what little reaſon our Diſſenters have to talk ſo much of Foreign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, for their caſe is very different; that which will juſtifie thoſe Foreign Churches which have no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, will not juſtifie our Diſſenters, who have Biſhops, but ſeparate from them. For though they have no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, they do not ſeparate from Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Churches, nor condemn Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, as an unlawful or Antichriſtian Government, but hold Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which our Diſſenters have rent and divided by Schiſmatical ſeparations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us then conſider, what may be ſaid in juſtification of thoſe reformed Churches, which have no Biſhops, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their want of Biſhops does un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church them, and make it unlawful for us to hold Communion with them. This
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:93053:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>is a very nice and tender point; for to condemn all the reformed Churches, which have no Biſhops, ſeems ſo hard and uncharitable, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has always declined it; but then abſolutely to juſtifie them, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the ancient government by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and is made uſe of by our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters to pull down Epiſcopacy, if the preſent Biſhops do not pleaſe them; which is impoſſible for any Biſhop to do, who will be true to his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to the conſtitutions of our Church.</p>
               <p>And therefore in ſtating this matter, I muſt go a middle way, neither abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to condemn, nor abſolutely to juſtifie them; For, 1. As believing the divine right of Epiſcopal Government, which I ſhall not now go about to prove, I muſt acknowledg thoſe Churches, which have no Biſhops, to be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and defective, and that they are bound, as far as they can, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reſtore the Epiſcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and if they fail in this, ſo far as they are chargeable with this neglect, what in ſome caſes is a pardonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, may become, eſpecially in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of ſuch a Church, a very great
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:93053:178"/>Crime. For no Church muſt wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly change a divine Inſtitution; we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for taking away the Cup from the Laity, and I think every divine Inſtitution has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſacred in it, as not to be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected or altered without abſolute neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet the caſe may be ſuch, that the want of Epiſcopal Government may not un-church ſuch a ſociety of Chriſtians, nor make it unlawful for other Chriſtians to maintain Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them. As will appear from theſe following conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the change of ſome poſitive Inſtitutions does not preſently un-church thoſe, who are guilty of it.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Eſpecially if the caſe be ſuch, that at leaſt they have a preſumptive allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the Catholick Church to do it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the change of ſome poſitive Inſtitutions does not preſentlyun-church thoſe, who are guilty of it. I need not ſpend many words to prove this, for when the caſe is propoſed in general, I think no man will deny it. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:93053:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>of all divine Inſtitutions is neceſſary to the perfection of a Church, but it is not ſo to the being of it: That is, though God does ſtrictly require the obſervance of all his Statutes, yet every poſitive command is not of that moment, that God will diſanul his Covenant with ſuch a People for the neglect or change of it.</p>
               <p>If ever God would have done this, we might moſt reaſonably expect it under the Jewiſh Oeconomy, in which every minute Circumſtance was ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded by God, as having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Sacred and Typical in it, and yet it does not appear, that every deviation from their Rule, though in ſome very material parts of it, did provoke God to caſt them off.</p>
               <p>God had appointed a certain place, where they ſhould offer their Sacrifices to him, and when this place was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fixed and determined, it was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to offer Sacrifice in any other place. And yet when the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was built, which was the only place God had appointed for Sacrifice, the People continued to offer Sacrifice in their high places, even in the Reign of very good Kings, and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:93053:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>though this practiſe was condemned, yet it did not un-church them.</p>
               <p>God had appointed <hi>Aarons</hi> Family for the Prieſthood,<note place="margin">1 Kings 12.31.</note> and yet <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made Prieſts of other Tribes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and the Law, which expreſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons for the Prieſts Office, only threatens death againſt Uſurpers:<note place="margin">Numb. 3.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt appoint</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons, and they ſhall wait on the Prieſts Office, and the stranger that cometh nigh ſhall be put to death.</hi> God did not reject the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of their Prieſts, but owned them for his Church and People many years after this, till they defiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> and other Heathen Gods. And <hi>Joſephus</hi> obſerves, that after the death of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joſeph. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq.</hi> l. 12. cap. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> made <hi>Alchymus</hi> High-Prieſt, who was not of the Family of the Prieſts; and yet I ſhould be loth to ſay, that ſuch an irregular promotion did un-church the Jewiſh Church; and whoever conſiders in what manner the High-Prieſts were advanced and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed even in the time of our Saviour, poſſibly may think it, as inconſiſtent with the firſt Inſtitution of that Office, as the irregular Ordinations of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:93053:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. We ought eſpecially to conſider the force and power of neceſſity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence even with divine Inſtitutions: No neceſſity can diſpence with the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws of good and evil, becauſe no neceſſity can be pleaded to juſtifie men in ſin, though in ſome caſes it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the evil and guilt of it, for the internal neceſſity in the nature of things is ſtronger than any external neceſſity can be; no external force can compel men to ſin, which is an Act of their own will and choice, and the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Vertue remain in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſſity. But in poſitive Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, which depend upon the Will of God, we find neceſſity has often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, and that with God's allowance and approbation. As to give ſome few examples of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The neceſſity of the divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has diſpenſed with poſitive Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus in <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> Sacrifice, the Prieſts being too few,<note place="margin">2 Ch ron. 29.34.35.11.</note> the Levites aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in doing the Prieſts work, in ſlaying the Sacrifices; and the like we may ſee in <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s Paſſeover. And by the ſame reaſon we may ſuppoſe, that if the Family of <hi>Aaron</hi> had failed, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Families of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> might
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:93053:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>have ſucceeded into the Prieſt's Office, though againſt a poſitive Law: For the neceſſity of the divine Worſhip is much greater and more unalterable, than the confinement of the Prieſthood to a certain Family, and where the divine Providence makes a neceſſity, neceſſity: will make a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore I think, a late learned and ingenious Author, who diſputes ſo earneſtly, that the Power of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Sacraments muſt be derived from God, and that this Power now is given only by Epiſcopal Ordination, ought to have diſtinguiſhed between the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and extraordinary conveyance of Power. Whoever adminiſters in holy things, muſt derive his Power from God, becauſe he acts in God's Name, and when it may be done, he muſt derive his Power in ſuch a way, as God hath appointed by a poſitive Law, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rejects this way without neceſſity, can have no valid Power, but whatever he does, is null and void; as I doubt not, but all Ordinations of Presbyters are in oppoſition to, and contempt of their Biſhops, as I think, that learned man hath ſufficiently proved: But the caſe of neceſſity ought to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:93053:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>it being contrary to the Nature of all poſitive Inſtitutions to oblige in caſe of neceſſity; and I take that to be a caſe of neceſſity, when Epiſcopal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders cannot be had, and yet the Church muſt ſail without them. Biſhops are for the Church, not the Church for Biſhops; and when the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of this Authority fails, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity legitimates other extraordinary ways. We have all the reaſon in the World to preſume in ſuch caſes, that God will confirm and ratifie the choice and deſignation of the People, much more the Ordinations of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where Epiſcopal Ordination cannot be had. For I ſee no reaſon, why Presbyters may not do the Biſhops work in caſe of neceſſity, as well as Levites do the work of Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The neceſſity of mens lives diſpenſe with poſitive Laws. Upon this account our Saviour juſtifies <hi>David</hi>'s eating the Shew-Bread, when he was an hungred, which was not lawful for him to eat,<note place="margin">Mark 2.24, 25, 26.</note> but for the Prieſts; and his Diſciples plucking the Ears of Corn on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: Upon this Principle, <hi>Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> allowed the Jews to fight on the Sabbath-day,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joſeph.</hi> antiq. l. 12. cap. 7.</note> in caſe they were aſſaulted
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:93053:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>by their Enemies; and our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves all ſuch caſes by that general Principle, <hi>I will have mercy and not Sacrifice;</hi> and certainly, mercy to the Souls of men is as conſiderable as any temporal concernments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But we may further conſider, what force and Authority the preſumptive allowance of the Church has in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The Chriſtian Church in all Ages has thought fit to diſpenſe with poſitive Inſtitutions in caſe of neceſſity, and by her own Approbation and Authority to ſupply the defects and irregularities of ſuch Adminiſtrations, and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did believe ſhe had Power to do it: And indeed if there be not ſufficient Authority in the Church to provide for caſes of neceſſity, the Power of the Church is more defective than of any other Society of men, and cannot in many caſes without a miracle preſerve her own being; and therefore if the Church may be preſumed in caſes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to allow Perſons to perform ſuch religious Offices and Miniſtries, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they are not qualified to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; this very allowance ſupplies the incapacity of the Perſon, and does virtually confer that Authority on him,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:93053:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>which in other caſes he had not.</p>
               <p>Now it is not only highly reaſonable to preſume, that the Catholick Church will rather allow the Ordinations of Presbyters, though they are not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly qualified for that Office, where there are no Biſhops to Ordain, than that a conſiderable member of the Chriſtian Church ſhould want a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Paſtors to inſtruct and govern them, and adminiſter all religious Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to them; but beſides the reaſon of the thing, the practiſe of the Church is a ſufficient ground for this preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For we know the uſe of Orders is to confer Authority and Power to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments, and yet the Church has allowed even Lay-men to baptize,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi eccleſiaſtici ordinis non eſt conſeſſus, &amp; offers, &amp; tinguis, &amp; ſacerdos es tibi ſolus. Tert. de exhort. caſt. cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> and if we will believe <hi>Tertullian</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate too, in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that is, where there have been no Biſhops, nor Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to adminiſter thoſe Offices, and we may as well preſume the allowance of the Church for Presbyters to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, when there are no Biſhops, as for Lay-men to adminiſter the Sacraments, where there are no Biſhops nor Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:93053:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>I alledge <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Authority, not for the ſake of his reaſon, but as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of primitive Practiſe: The reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of particular men do not always expreſs the ſence of the Church, but their own private Opinions, though they may be allowed to be good Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, what the practiſe of the Church was in their days: Though I confeſs, I cannot ſee, that any thing <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays, does derogate from the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prieſthood, or deſtroy the diſtinction between the Clergy and Laity, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to invade the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Function.<note place="margin">Nonne &amp; laici ſacerdotes ſumus? ſcriptum eſt, regnum quo<expan>

Well but is there no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then betwixt the Chriſtian Clergy and People? Yes, this he owns, but ſays it is by the appointment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:93053:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Church. What does he mean by this? That it is a humane, arbitrary, and alterable Conſtitution? By no means! But it is the honour of a peculiar Sanctification and Separation of certain Perſons to the work of the Miniſtry, to which God has annexed his Bleſſing and Authority. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conſtitution of the Church here includes the Authority of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, who from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning have made this diſtinction, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> every where confeſſes.</p>
               <p>To what purpoſe then is all this?<note place="margin">Si habes jus ſacerdotis in temet ipſo, ubi neceſſe eſt, habeas opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet etiam diſciplinam ſacerdotis, ubi neceſſe ſit habere jus ſacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. Ib.</note> How does he hence prove, that every man in caſe of neceſſity is a Prieſt to himſelf? That he has the right of Prieſthood in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when it is neceſſary, and therefore may perform the Office of a Prieſt alſo, when it is neceſſary? For if Chriſt and his Apoſtles have from the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Chriſtian Church made a diſtinction between the Evangelical Prieſthood and the People, and have inſtituted the Miniſterial Office with a peculiar Power and Authority, how can it be lawful for a private Chriſtian up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a pretence of the general Prieſthood
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:93053:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Chriſtians, in any caſe whatſoever, to perform ſuch religious Acts, as are peculiar to the Evangelical Miniſtry?</p>
               <p>But the force of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s reaſon ſeems to conſiſt in this; That all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians being an Evangelical Prieſthood, to offer up the ſpiritual Sacrifices of Prayers and Thankſgivings to God, through the merits and mediation of our great High-Prieſt, they are not debarr'd by any perſonal incapacity, nor by the typical and myſterious Nature of the Chriſtian Inſtitutions, from performing any religious Office, which Chriſt has commanded his Church; but yet for the better ſecurity of publick Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the more regular Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of religious Offices, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Unity, Order, Diſcipline, and Government in the Church, Chriſt hath committed the power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſcipline, and publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of religious Offices, to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons peculiarly devoted and ſet apart for the work of the Miniſtry. But the Inſtitution of this Order being wholly for the ſervice of the Church, and not for any other myſtical reaſons, in caſe of failure, where there are none of this holy Order to perform religious Offices,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:93053:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>the univerſal Prieſthood of Chriſtians takes place, and any private Chriſtian without a regular and external Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration to this Function, may perform all the Duties and Offices of a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>For there are two things, wherein the Aaronical and Evangelical Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood differ, which make a mighty alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this caſe. The Aaronical Prieſthood was Typical or Myſtical, and Mediatory, the Evangelical Prieſthood is neither: Now all men cannot pretend a right to a Myſtical, much leſs to a Mediatory Prieſthood, but only ſuch, as have a divine appointment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to this Office; for the nature of Types and Myſteries is loſt, if the Perſon be not fitted to the Myſtery, and the vertue of the Mediation is loſt, (at leaſt our abſolute aſſurance of it) if the Perſon do not act by Authority and Commiſſion: But now under the Goſpel, the Inſtitutions of our Saviour are plain and ſimple, without any ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and figures, and therefore there is nothing in the nature of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which requires peculiar and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Perſons; and Chriſt is now our only Mediator between God and men, and therefore we need not any
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:93053:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>other Mediators of divine appointment, in vertue of the Sacrifice and Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, every Chriſtian is a Prieſt, who may approach the Throne of Grace, and offer up his prayers and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings in an acceptable manner to God. Goſpel-Miniſters indeed are to pray for the People, and to bleſs in God's name, but they pray in no ſenſe as Mediators, but in the name of our great Mediator<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and that, which makes their Prayers more effectual than the Prayers of a private Chriſtian, is, that they are the publick Miniſters of the Church, and therefore offer up the Prayers of the Church, which are more powerful than the Prayers of private Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>And therefore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> reproves <hi>Parmenianus</hi> the Donatiſt, for making the Biſhop a Mediator between God and the People, which no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can endure the thoughts of, but muſt needs account ſuch a man rather to be Antichriſt,<note place="margin">Auguſt. contra. ep. Parmen. l. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> than an Apoſtle of Chriſt. For all Chriſtian men pray for each other, but he who prays for all, and none for him, is the only and the true Mediator; of whom the High Prieſt under the Law was a Type, and therefore no man was to pray for the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:93053:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>High-Prieſt. But St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who knew, that Chriſt was our only Mediator, who was entred into Heaven for us, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends himſelf to the Prayers of the Church; and is ſo far from making himſelf a Mediator between God and the People, that he exhorts all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to pray for one another, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Body; for if <hi>Paul</hi> had been a Mediator, the other Apoſtles had been Mediators too, and ſo we ſhould have a great many Mediators, and not, as he himſelf tells us, one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; and therefore he ſays, that the Prayers of wicked Biſhops are heard for the People, not for the Biſhop's ſake, but <hi>pro devotione populorum,</hi> for the Peoples Devotion, or as they are the Prayers of the Church. And when the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> proved, that wicked Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops could not miniſter in holy things, becauſe under the Law no man was to officiate as a Prieſt, who had any ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh or defect, he anſwers, that this was only Typical of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ib. cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> and fulfilled only in him.</p>
               <p>So that the Apoſtolical or Epiſcopal Office, though it be frequently by the Ancients called <hi>Sacerdotium,</hi> in alluſion to the Aaronical Prieſthood, yet indeed
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:93053:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>it hath nothing of the proper nature of the Aaronical Prieſthood in it, but is inſtituted by Chriſt for Inſtruction, Diſcipline, and Government, and the publick Adminiſtration of religious Offices. It was very requiſite indeed, that Chriſt himſelf ſhould inveſt the Governors of his Church with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power for this Office, and it is neceſſary to the Peace, Order, and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Church, that no man ſhould uſurp this Power and Authority to himſelf, but receive it from the hands of thoſe, who have Power to give it; and therefore this Apoſtolical Power, excepting the caſe of neceſſity, is as ſaored and inviolable as the Prieſthood it ſelf; but in caſe of neceſſity, where the ſucceſſion of Apoſtolical Power fails, or a plenary Authority to convey it, it admits of a more eaſie redreſs, than the failure of a Myſtical or Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Prieſthood would do: For there is no Office of Religion, but in ſuch a caſe any Chriſtian may perform, we being all Prieſts to God through Jeſus Chriſt; and as for Authority, neceſſity and the deſignation of fit Perſons by the Church, when the regular ways of conveyance fail, may be very eaſily
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:93053:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>preſumed to be approved and confirmed by God.</p>
               <p>This I take to be the true ſence of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s argument, which I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the more largely, becauſe ſome men are very apt to abuſe all ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to the diminution of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Office, though with what little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I think, is very evident; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Argument, or whether the Church proceeded upon theſe Principles, or not in granting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Lay-men, to baptize in caſe of neceſſity, the Practiſe of the Church is plain in this matter, thus it was in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, and thus it has been in moſt Ages of the Church ever ſince, and is to this day allowed in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and if the Church allows Lay-men in caſe of neceſſity to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Sacraments; we may reaſonably preſume, it will in the ſame neceſſity allow of the Ordinations of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only obſerve further, that this practiſe of the Church in allowing the baptiſm of Lay-men in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, ſeems to me utterly to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw thoſe Principles, which a learned Author has Publiſhed in his late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:93053:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Schiſm. Some of his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are theſe; That Salvation is not ordinarily to be expected without an external participation of the Sacraments. That the Validity of the Sacraments, depends upon the Authority of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by whom they are adminiſtred; they being the Seals of the Covenant, which as in all Covenants between man and man, are void in Law, if they be not applyed by Perſons, who have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to ſeal. This Authority of applying the Seals of the Covenant can be derived only from God, and that only by Epiſcopal Ordinations.</p>
               <p>Now I muſt profeſs my diſſent from this Learned man upon more accounts than one, at preſent it may ſuffize, that either theſe Principles are falſe, or the Catholick Church has been in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous miſtake, in allowing the Baptiſm of private Chriſtians, where there were no Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters to do it. For if the Validity of Baptiſm depends upon the Authority of him, who baptizes, then the Baptiſm of Lay-men, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Principles can have no ſuch Authority, muſt be actually void, and have no ſaving effect, and then the Catholick Church ever ſince <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:93053:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>time has erred in a matter neceſſary to Salvation: And how ſpecious ſoever any Arguments may be, I ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways jealous of ſuch a Concluſion, as charges the Primitive and Catholick Church with ignorance and error, ſo dangerous and deſtructive to mens Souls.</p>
               <p>This learned man was aware of this,<note place="margin">Separation of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 143.</note> and therefore confeſſes, <hi>For my part I do not underſtand, how the validity of Laicks, and much more womens Baptiſm (who by the Apoſtles rule are much leſs capable of Fccleſiaſtical Authority) can be defended, unleſs it may poſſibly be by that general delegation, which may be conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been granted to them by the Governors, by thoſe customs and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which permit them to adminiſter it. But it would then be a further doubt, how far ſuch Perſons as theſe are capable of ſuch a delegation?

The matter of Fact is confeſſed by him, that in caſe of neceſſity Laicks were allowed to baptize, which overthrows his whole Hypotheſis, whereby he confines this to Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:93053:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>If the Church in caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity has permitted Laicks to baptize, we may preſume, that in the ſame neceſſity, ſhe will allow Presbyters to Ordain; if Laicks are not capable of ſuch a delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the Catholick Church has erred in a fundamental Practiſe, which is neceſſary to Salvation; if they be, then the adminiſtration of Sacraments is not in all caſes abſolutely confined to the Clergy, for all ſuch caſes muſt be excepted, wherein the Church has Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpenſe; for this delegated Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er does not make them Eccleſiaſtical Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, but gives Authority or Permiſſion to Laicks in ſuch caſes to do the work of a Biſhop, or of other conſecrated Perſons.</p>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:93053:188"/>caſe of neceſſity is as conſiderable as any: And the neceſſity of preſerving the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church, ſeems to me as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, as the preſervation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which is only in order to the preſervation of its being.</p>
               <p>But this is a matter of ſuch great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I cannot paſs it over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a more particular Examination of ſome Principles, on which that learned man grounds that ſevere concluſion of the Invalidity of all Sacraments, which are not adminiſtred by Biſhops, or by Presbyters Epiſcopally Ordained; which, I hope, I may do in ſuch a Cauſe as this, wherein ſo many foreign Churches are concerned, without the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of that real honour and friendſhip I have for him. And to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with all poſſible clearneſs in this matter, I ſhall reduce the ſtate of the Controverſie between us to a narrow point, and briefly ſhew, wherein we agree, and wherein we differ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then I readily grant, that the external participation of the Chriſtian Sacraments, of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper, is ordinarily neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:93053:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. I grant alſo, that the Biſhops and Miniſters of the Church regularly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, have the only ordinary Power of adminiſtring Sacraments, and that all Sacraments adminiſtred and received in oppoſition to, and contempt of the ordinary Governors of the Church, are invalid, or inefficacious.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But I abſolutely deny, that the validity of the Sacraments depends upon the Authority of the Perſons admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring This is the parting point, and therefore muſt be carefully examined. And I find but two general Arguments this learned man uſes for the Proof of it. From the nature of the Sacraments, and from the ends of Government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering God as a Covenanter, and as a Governor.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the nature of the Sacraments, or conſidering God as a Covenanter; and ſo the adminiſtration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is celebrating or making a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in God's Name, ſo as to oblige him to performance of it, which no man can do, unleſs God ſignifie it to be his Pleaſure to empower him to do ſo, as in Law, no man can be obliged by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers act, who has not been empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to act in his Name by his Letters
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:93053:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Proxy. And he that preſumes of himſelf to make a Covenant, wherein God is by him engaged as a Party, without being ſo empowered by God, as what he does, cannot in any legal expoſition be reputed as God's act, ſo neither can it infer any legal obligation of him to performance.</p>
               <p>This Argument is drawn out to a great length, but this I take to be the ſum of it, and it were a very ſtrong Argument, if the Foundation of it were not falſe; but I muſt deny that, which this Author has all along taken for granted without any Proof; that the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, as ſuppoſe of Baptiſm, is the Miniſters making a Covenant with the Perſon baptized in God's Name.</p>
               <p>I know of but one Covenant, which God has made with mankind in Chriſt Jeſus, and that is the Goſpel-Covenant; and I know of but one ſealing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this Covenant, and that is by the Blood of Chriſt; and therefore the Sacraments cannot be ſuch Seals, as ratifie and confirm the Covenant, and give validity to it, or paſs an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on God to ſtand to his Covenant. The Chriſtian Sacraments are neceſſary
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:93053:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>parts, duties, or conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, either for our admiſſion to the Priviledges, or conveyance of the Grace of the Covenant, and therefore they cannot in a proper ſence be Seals of, or making a Covenant in God's Name. All mankind are capable of being received into this Covenant; the Covenant is actually made to the Chriſtian Church, and every Member of it; Baptiſm is our admiſſion into the Chriſtian Church, and conſequently to all the priviledges of the Covenant; it is very fitting, that the ordinary Power of ſuch admiſſions ſhould be in the hands of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and ſo it is by divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but all this is a very different thing, from making a Covenant in God's Name, which ſhall validly oblige God to the performance of it. This, it is plain, no man can do, without the moſt expreſs Authority, but the external ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of a Covenant, which are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, confirmed, commanded by God, need not in all caſes ſuch expreſs Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for in this caſe we do not preſume to make a Covenant in God's Name, or to oblige him by our Act, but only to do what he has required and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done, though not expreſly
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:93053:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>commanded us in particular to do it. We neither make any new terms for God, which he has not already made, and obliged himſelf to the performance of, nor admit any Perſons to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of this Covenant, whom God has excluded, for the Covenant is made with all mankind, who believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but we only do the ordinary work of Church Governors, without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Authority of Governors, upon a reaſonable preſumption, that God will allow of this, where there are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Governors to do it: Which is a reaſonable preſumption in all humane Governments, where a regular Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity fails, and cannot be ſupplyed in an ordinary way; a Topick, which this learned Author makes great and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of.</p>
               <p>And methinks, it might ſatisfie any reaſonable man, what a vaſt difference there is between making a Covenant in God's Name, and performing ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Solemnities of it, if he only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that Covenant, which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the ſign of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which was Circumciſion, a Seal of the righteouſneſs of Faith.</p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:93053:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Whatever this learned man urges to prove the neceſſity of a valid Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Adminiſtrator to make Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm valid, will prove the ſame neceſſity of a valid Authoirty to make Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion valid; for what Baptiſm is in the new Covenant, that Circumciſion was in God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> both equally alike Signs or Seals or external Solemnities of the Covenant; and yet it is ſufficiently known,<note place="margin">Buxtorfii Synagoga Judaica, <hi>cap. 4.</hi>
                  </note> that any <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi> might circumciſe, that underſtood how to do it.</p>
               <p>The Adminiſtration of Baptiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is confined ordinarily to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church, whereas the adminiſtration of Circumciſion never was the peculiar Office of the Prieſt, and the reaſon of this difference is plain, becauſe every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> by birth had a right to Circumciſion, and therefore there was no need of any Authority to receive them into the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the external Solemnity might be performed by any man; but natural Generation does not give any man a right to Baptiſm, but Faith in Chriſt, and therefore it is fit, that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church only ſhould have Power to judge, who are fit to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:93053:191"/>into the Chriſtian Church, and therefore that the power of adminiſtring Baptiſm ſhould be reſerved in their hands; but hence it appears, that in adminiſtring the Sacraments, they do not act, as legal Covenanters in God's Name, but as Governors of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And this brings me to conſider his Arguments from the Nature and Ends of Government, which as far as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them amount to this. That it is neceſſary for God to maintain and preſerve the Authority of ſubordinate Governors. That the Authority of Church Governors conſiſts in the power of adminiſtring Sacraments, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Title to all the Priviledges and Graces of the Covenant. That this Authority cannot be maintained, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authorized Perſons may validly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments, and therefore we cannot ſuppoſe, that God will counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſuch an uſurpation of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority, as to confirm and allow, what is ſo illegally done.</p>
               <p>Now in Anſwer to this, I readily grant, 1. That this is a very good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove, that the Authority of adminiſtring Sacraments is in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:93053:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>caſes confined to the regular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, for indeed this is all the Authority Church Governors have, to receive in, and to put out of the Church, and take away this, and all Church-ſocieties muſt immediately diſſolve, or hang together only by ſome arbitrary Compacts and Covenants, which laſt as long as every man pleaſes.</p>
               <p>But then 2. I obſerve, that it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſecure the Authority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, to confine the adminiſtration of Sacraments, and all acts of Eccleſiaſtical Authority to Church-Governors, where-ever there are ſuch to be found. For if no private man muſt preſume to adminiſter Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a conſtituted Church, where there are Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters, though we grant Laicks the liberty of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Sacraments, where there are no regular Miniſters to do it; this can be no reaſonable pretence for their inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Miniſterial Function, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the Peace and Order of the Church, where there are. He who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes the only valid Authority of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring Sacraments to the regular Clergy, where there are ſuch Perſons to be found, does as effectually ſecure
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:93053:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Authority of Church-Governors, as he, who makes it abſolutely unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for private Chriſtians, in any caſe whatſoever, to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For the Authority of Church-governors is a meer notion without any effect, where there are no ſuch Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and where there are, their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is ſecure this way. No man thinks it any injury to the Authority of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Civil Governors, to aſſert, that every private man has liberty to defend his own Life and Fortune, where he is not under the protection of Laws, and publick Juſtice, no more is it any inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Authority of the Clergy, for private Chriſtians to do the Office of a Biſhop or a Presbyter, where there is no Biſhop or Presbyter to do it. No doubt, but God is greatly concerned to maintain the Authority of Church-governors, becauſe the welfare and preſervation of the Church depends on it, but we cannot think, the Rules of Order and Government are ſo ſtrict, as to diſſolve the Society of the Church which it is deſigned to maintain.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that it is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to Eccleſiaſtical Authority, to grant the leaſt indulgence or liberty to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:93053:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>Laicks, or an irregular Clergy, in any caſe whatſoever, to inermeddle in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Offices; for they will always be apt to take more than is granted; and thus that Liberty, which is allowed in extraordinary caſes, will be improved into an ordinary uſurpation of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Office. I anſwer, It may be ſo, and I know no way to prevent thoſe ill Conſequences, which fooliſh Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may draw from Truth it ſelf, nor that ill uſe, which wild and giddy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may make of the juſteſt Liberties, but muſt we deny Truth, or deny our own juſt Liberties and Rights for this reaſon?</p>
               <p>But yet this is not the caſe here, for there is a greater ſecurity of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority, than the Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments its ſelf, and that is, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary obligations to Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which cannot be preſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a juſt deference to Eccleſiaſtical Authority: It may be lawful in ſome caſes for Laicks to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but it is never lawful for them to ſeparate from their Governors, or to oppoſe their Authority.</p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:93053:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Should a company of private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on their own choice ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their Biſhops, and unite into a Church-Society, this were a Church-Faction and Schiſm, and all they did were null and void; but if private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who live in Communion with their Biſhops, and own their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being reduced to that neceſſity, that they cannot enjoy the Sacraments, nor other religious Offices from Perſons, who have a regular Authority, ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacraments themſelves, and celebrate religious Offices for their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Comfort, I cannot ſee, that it is either Schiſm, or Uſurpation, and the perpetual obligations to Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion will prevent both.</p>
               <p>Indeed nothing can ſecure the Peace and Unity of the Church, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Eccleſiaſtical Governors, but the neceſſity of Catholick Communion; for the Unity of the Church, and the juſt Authority of Biſhops, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by an Epiſcopal, as well as by a Presbyterian, or a Lay Schiſm. Thus it was by the Schiſm of the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> They were governed by Biſhops, as well as the Catholick Church, and their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Sacraments adminiſtred by
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:93053:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>them were allowed to be valid, and yet they were Schiſmaticks, and their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, though valid with reſpect to the Authority, which adminiſtred them, yet without effect, as adminiſtred in a Schiſm, as I have already ſhewed from St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And therefore that Father in his Writings againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> does not oppoſe their Schiſm from the Invalidity of their Orders, or of their Sacraments, which is no argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Epiſcopal Schiſm, (though it be the only argument uſed by this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, to ſhew the evil and danger of Schiſm) but from their breach of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, which made all their Sacraments, though not invalid, yet inefficacious. So that Eccleſiaſtical Authority may be ſecured, though we allow Laicks in caſe of neceſſity a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to adminiſter Sacraments in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Communion of the Church.</p>
               <p>It were eaſie to add a great deal more of this Nature, but this is ſufficient to my preſent deſign. And the reſult of this whole Diſcourſe is, that it is not in all caſes and circumſtances unlawful to maintain Catholick Communion with ſuch a Church, as being forced to it by neceſſity, is neither governed by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:93053:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>nor by Presbyters Epiſcopally ordained.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There ſtill remains the third and fourth terms of Catholick Communion to be conſidered, the Diſcipline of the Church, and Eccleſiaſtical Rites and Ceremonies, which I ſhall briefly ſpeak to both together.</p>
               <p>Now Diſcipline in the ancient uſe of the Word has a large ſignification, and includes all religious Worſhip, as well as Church Cenſures, eſpecially the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sacraments; for Church Diſcipline conſiſts in admitting men to, or exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them from the Communion, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Sacraments of Chriſtians. Thus <hi>Diſciplina ſacerdotis,</hi> in <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the whole exerciſe of the Prieſtly Office, even the adminiſtration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, of Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper. And by Eccleſiaſtical Rites and Ceremonies, I mean ſuch external circumſtances and appendages of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Time, Place, Habits, Poſtures, or ſignificant Rites, as are of humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and may be either enjoyned or altered by Church Governors, and do actually differ according to the Cuſtoms of ſeveral Churches.</p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:93053:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Now to reduce what I have to ſay under this Head, into as narrow a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs as I can, I ſhall premiſe ſeveral things, which I preſume will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged without a Proof by the Perſons I have now to deal with.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is neceſſary to Catholick Communion, that every Church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the eſſentials of Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and particularly the Chriſtian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as inſtituted by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That their Worſhip be pure from all Idolatrous mixtures, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which is a ſufficient juſtification of our ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſuppoſe, it will be granted alſo that there is no Church ſo pure, but that it has bad men, and too often bad Miniſters in its Communion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there have in all ages been various Rites and Ceremonies uſed in the Chriſtian Church, and very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in different Churches. This no man will deny, but one, who is either very ignorant himſelf, or a very impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent impoſer upon the ignorance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:93053:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="5">5. That among true and orthodox Churches, which believe all the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Faith, and obſerve all the Eſſentials of Worſhip, there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees of purity in Diſcipline, and Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſome more, ſome leſs, for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the Church.</p>
               <p>This having been in former Ages, and being now at preſent the ſtate of the Chriſtian Church, it is evident, what a Catholick Chriſtian muſt do, who will maintain Catholick Communion with the ſeveral Chriſtian Churches in the World.</p>
               <p>As, 1. He muſt communicate with Churches, which are not ſo ſtrict and regular in their Diſcipline, as he could wiſh. There being few Churches in the World, ſo exact in this matter, but a wiſe and good man may diſcover ſuch defects in their Diſcipline, as he could wiſh amended. And he, who will not communicate with any Church, nor live in any Common-wealth, which has any defects in its Government, is not fit to live in this World, where there is no abſolute perfection to be found, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church or State.</p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:93053:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. He muſt communicate with ſuch Churches, wherein there are a great many bad, as well as good men, for this is the ſtate of all Churches on Earth, where the Tares grow up with the Wheat.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They muſt communicate with Churches, which obſerve ſeveral uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and ſignificant Ceremonies, for thus moſt Churches in the World do, and have always done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nay they muſt communicate with Churches, which have very different, if not contrary Cuſtoms. There being few Churches, wherein the external Modes, Rites, and Ceremonies of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip are in all things alike.</p>
               <p>It is evident, as any matter of Fact can be, that no true Chriſtian Churches in the World, can communicate with each other upon any other terms than theſe, and therefore it is a vain thing to talk of any other, and to condemn theſe terms of Communion, as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, makes Catholick Communion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
               <p>Whoever ſeparates from any Church, upon a pretence of ſome defects and imperfections in Worſhip or Diſcipline, when all the eſſentials of Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:93053:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>are preſerved entire and pure, without any ſuch corrupt mixtures as make their Worſhip ſinful; whoever ſeparates from a Church, becauſe there are a great many bad men in it, or for the ſake of ſome indifferent Cuſtoms, and ſignificant Ceremonies, muſt for the ſame reaſon ſeparate from all the Churches in the World, even from the moſt Primitive and Apoſtolical Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the firſt ages of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Now if Catholick Communion be ſo eſſential to the being and notion of the Catholick Church, thoſe Principles muſt be falſe and Schiſmatical, which are ſo irreconcileable with Catholick Communion. For it is plain we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at this day, nor ever could, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Catholick Church, if every defect in Worſhip or Diſcipline, if indifferent rites and uſages in religious Worſhip, if corrupt and vicious Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers make the Communion of any Church unlawful, and be a juſt reaſon for Separation.</p>
               <p>This indeed has always been the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence both of ancient and modern Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. The <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſeparated for a ſtricter Diſcipline, and purer Communion, and were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:93053:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>for it by the Catholick Church. And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> proves at large againſt the <hi>Donatists,</hi> that neither the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Miniſter, nor of the People, corrupt the Worſhip, or make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſuch a Church ſinful, though through the defect of Diſcipline, the one ſhould not be depoſed, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther removed from Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>For indeed the ancient Fathers thought Catholick Communion ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, that very few things could come in Competition with it. We have a famous example of this in St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> who diſputed very earneſtly for the neceſſity of baptizing thoſe, who had been baptized by Hereticks, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they returned to the Communion of the Church. <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did as vehemently oppoſe it, with ſome ſharp reflexions upon St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and did admit thoſe to Communion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm, who had been baptized by Hereticks. But St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> like a true Catholick Chriſtian,<note place="margin">Neminem jadicantes, aut à jure communio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis aliquem, ſi diverſum ſenſerit, amoventes, prefat. Concil. Carth.</note> declares in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Council of Carthage, that
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:93053:197"/>he would not deny Communion to any of his Colleagues, who differed from him in this point. And in his Letter to <hi>Jubaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nos, quantum in nobis eſt, propter Heretices cumcollegis &amp; coepiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis noſtris non contendimus, cum quibus divinam concordiam &amp; dominicam pacem tenemus. <hi>Cyp.</hi> ep. ad. <hi>Jubai.</hi>
                  </note> he profeſſes that he will not quarrel with his Colleagues for the ſake of Hereticks. And yet as St. <hi>Austin</hi> well obſerves, this Diſpute was of great conſequence to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church: For if St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> was in the right, then the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt. de baptiſmo. l. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> who received thoſe to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion without Baptiſm, who had been formerly baptized by Hereticks, received thoſe to Communion, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any valid Baptiſm, and yet St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who did believe this, rather choſe to communicate with that Church, which admitted unbaptized Perſons into her Communion, than to diſturb the Peace, and divide the Communion of the Chriſtian Church. For indeed that Father lookt upon the Communion of the Church, as neceſſary and effectual to Salvation, as the Sacraments themſelves, nay able to ſupply the defects of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For in his Epiſtle to <hi>Jubaianus,</hi> in anſwer to that Queſtion, what ſhall become of thoſe, who have formerly
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:93053:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>been received into the Church without Baptiſm, he tells him, <hi>the Lord is able of his own mercy to grant Pardon and Indulgence to thoſe, who returning to the Church, and being only barely admitted to the Communion of it, dyed in its Peace and Communion, and not to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from the Rewards of his Church.</hi> That is, that living in Communion with the Church, is able to ſupply even the want of Baptiſm itſelf. And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> diſcourſes very much to the ſame purpoſe;<note place="margin">Homines enim ſumus, unde ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid aliter ſapere, quam ſe res habet, humana tentatio eſt, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis autem amando ſententiam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, vel invidendo melioribus uſ<expan>

                  </note> and obſerves, that whatever different apprehenſions we may have of many things, the ſafeſt way is to continue in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, which will ſanctifie our very errors and miſtakes. To be ſure you cannot name any thing in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Diſcipline of greater moment, than this Diſpute about the re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of Hereticks,<note place="margin">Aug. contra Parmenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni epiſt. l. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> and yet St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> did not think this a ſufficient reaſon to break Communion. In a Word, nothing can be better ſaid about Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, than what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> has obſerved; that many times things are at that paſs,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:93053:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>that it is neceſſary to looſen the reins of Diſcipline to prevent a Schiſm, which an unſeaſonable ſeverity may threaten the Church with; the number of bad men in a Church may make Diſcipline unpracticable in ſome caſes, and it is better for good men to tolerate the bad, who cannot defile their Communion, than to break communion with thoſe who are good.</p>
               <p>As for Eccleſiaſtical Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, there is an admirable Epiſtle of St. <hi>Austin</hi> to <hi>Januarius,</hi> which ſtates this whole matter. He firſt obſerves,<note place="margin">Aug. ep. Januario <hi>118.</hi>
                  </note> that the Yoke of Chriſt is very eaſie and gentle; that he has united his Church into one Body and Society, by very few Sacraments, eaſie to be obſerved, and excellent in their ſignification, ſuch as Baptiſm, and the Lod's Supper, or whatever other obſervances we find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in the holy Scripture, excepting the ſervitude of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>But there are other things obſerved by the Church, which are not written in the Scriptures, but received by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſuch obſervances as theſe which are received by the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, are either of Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtitution, or the Decrees of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:93053:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>Councils, which have the greateſt and moſt beneficial Authority in the Church. Such are the Annual Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities in memory of the Paſſion, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Aſcenſion of our Lord, and the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, which are obſerv'd in all parts of the Church. For it ſeems, in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s time the ſuperſtition of theſe days had not been diſcovered.</p>
               <p>But there are ſome Cuſtoms, which are obſerved differently in ſeveral Churches. As ſome faſt on the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, others do not. Some receive the Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt every day, others only at certain times, others only on Saturday, and Sunday, others only on Sundays.<note place="margin">Totum hoc genus rerum liberas habet obſervationes, nec diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ulla eſt in his melior gravi prudenti<expan>

For the Church of <hi>Milan</hi> did not faſt on the Saturday, according to the cuſtom of many other Churches, and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Mother following him thither, and being uncertain what ſhe ſhould do; whether obſerve the cuſtom of her own Church, to faſt on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or the cuſtom of the Church of <hi>Milan,</hi> where ſhe then was, not to do it; he conſulted St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> about it, who returned him this anſwer. When I am at <hi>Rome,</hi> I faſt on Saturdays, when I am here, I do not. And thus I would have you do, to obſerve the Cuſtom of the Church, whither you come, if you would neither be a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to others, nor have them a ſcandal to you. A great deal more to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there is in that excellent Epiſtle, and indeed theſe are the only terms of Catholick Communion. For if every
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:93053:200"/>different Cuſtom, Uſage, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in a Church, ſhall cauſe a Separation, there are few Churches can live in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with each other. And thus I hope, I have made it appear, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion is not an impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable notion, but is indeed as eaſie, as it is neceſſary to be obſerved.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> An Examination of Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s ſuggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to prove the Diſſenters, according to my own Principles, to be no Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and a further inquiry who is the divider.</head>
               <p>IT will not be amiſs now after all this grave and ſerious Diſcourſe, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert my Readers a little with a more pleaſant and entertaining Scene. For Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> ſeems to me to be a great Droll, and to maintain a Diſpute by the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible power of Wit, and pleaſant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, where Arguments fail. It is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to obſerve with what admirable art and dexterity he has retorted my Arguments upon my ſelf, and given life to a dying and languiſhing Cauſe, with
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:93053:200"/>the ſame Weapons, which gave it its mortal Wound. I thought, I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our Diſſenters, who ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as far as proving their Separation to be Schiſm, and anſwering their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pleas for Separation, proved them Schiſmaticks; but Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> has diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I have been kinder to them, than I was aware of, and by my own Principles have excuſed them from Schiſm, which, I aſſure you, if it prove ſo, will be the beſt Confutation of my Principles, and make me greatly ſuſpect them my ſelf. There are ſeveral inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of this nature ſcattered here and there in his reply, which require no very ſerious anſwer; for if he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for ſerious Arguments, he is a wit indeed. As to give ſome inſtances of this nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſays,<note place="margin">Reply, p. 13.</note> I place <hi>Schiſm in a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the Catholick Church, which notion taken ſingly will ſtand the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and all true Chriſtians, who must be acknowledged to be Members of the Catholick Church, in great stead, freeing them from the odious ſin of Schiſm. The Diſſenters divide not themſelves from the Communion of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> ergo
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:93053:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>not Schiſmaticks.</hi> Now I would deſire all Diſſenters to remember, what Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> grants; that there is ſuch a ſin as Schiſm, and that it is a very odious ſin, which would ſtand them in more ſtead, if they ſeriouſly thought of it, than his Defence and Apology will do.</p>
               <p>But Diſſenters, he ſays, do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves from the Communion of the Univerſal Church: What he means by this I cannot well tell, for I am ſure, their Principles, upon which they divide from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> do equally divide them from all the Churches in the World: And if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on meer humour they will divide from one Church, and not from another, where the reaſon of Separation is the ſame, they are nevertheleſs Schiſmaticks for that. Let Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> tell me, what Church for above twelve hundred years, they could have communicated with upon ſo good terms, as they may now with the Church of <hi>England?</hi> If Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Epiſcopacy, Forms of Prayer, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in Diſcipline, Corrupt Members in Church Communion, Eccleſiaſtical Rites and Ceremonies, or unſcriptural Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, as they call them, be a ſufficient reaſon to juſtifie Separation, what
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:93053:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>Church they ever could, or can to this day communicate with? The Foreign Proteſtant Churches, though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in ſome things from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not in Judgment, but in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, of which I have given ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count above, yet they communicate with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which according to the Laws of Catholick Communion, makes it as unlawful to communicate with them, as with the Church of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But he ſays, <hi>Diſſenters, and all true Chriſtians (though I hope, all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are not Diſſenters, whether Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be true Christians or not) muſt be acknowledged to be members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church:</hi> How far this muſt be acknowledged, I have examined above; Schiſmaticks in a looſe general Notion belong to the Church, though they are not Members of the Catholick Church, which is but one Communion; and thus diſſenting Separatiſts are Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſtill.</p>
               <p>But though it were poſſible, that our Diſſenters might find ſome other Church, beſide their own Conventicles, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with, yet they actually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves from the Catholick
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:93053:202"/>Church, by breaking Communion with any one ſound part of it, eſpecially with ſuch a part of the Church, as they are more particularly bound to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with. The Catholick Church is but one Communion, and whoever cauſeleſly breaks this Communion, as he does, who ſeparates from any ſound part of the Church, is a Schiſmatick, eſpecially he that ſeparates from the Church wherein he lives, which is the caſe of our Diſſenters in ſeparating from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If you ſeparate the Arm from the Shoulder, you ſeparate it from the whole Body; the Union of every Member with the Body, is its Union to that part of the Body which is next; for the whole Body is nothing elſe, but all the parts united to each other in their proper place and order: And if the Church be one Body, and one Communion, he that ſeparates from the Communion of the Church, where he lives, is a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, though he may pretend to an imaginary Communion with <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches, with the Churches of <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Ruſſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:93053:202"/>
               <p>But as much as Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> pretends, that notion will ſtand the Diſſenters in ſtead, that Schiſm is a Separation from the Catholick Church, it is plain, he does not like it, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches it, as a Popiſh notion, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſſerted by Papiſts: I ſhould be heartily glad to ſee any Papiſt aſſert this, for it would bid fair to put an end to Popery; but I doubt, Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> wrongs the Papiſts, and miſtakes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick for <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Church: They own no Catholick, but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholick</hi> Church, and know no Schiſm, but a Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> thinks this is no great matter; for I only change <hi>England</hi> for <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſet up an <hi>Engliſh-Catholick,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Church, which whatever other fault it have, I hope, he will acknowledg to be a change a little for the better; but let us hear his own words. He ſays, <hi>I cloſe with the ſame Popiſh Faction,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>in aſſerting, that ſeparating from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>is a Separation from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, as if the Catholick Church had been as much confined within the bounds of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:93053:203"/>ſay within the limits of</hi> Rome: What a bleſſed thing is Ignorance, which helps men to confute Books without fear or wit! What Papiſts are thoſe, who confine the Catholick Church within the limits of <hi>Rome?</hi> Do not they own the Churches of <hi>Italy, Spain, France, Germany,</hi> to be Catholick Churches, and would own all the Churches in the World to be ſo, would they ſubject themſelves to the Pope of <hi>Rome?</hi> They do not deſire to confine the Catholick Church within the limits of <hi>Rome,</hi> but deſire to extend it as far as <hi>England,</hi> and all the World over. But ſtill <hi>Rome</hi> is the beginning of Unity and Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, and no Church muſt be owned for a Catholick Church, which does not live in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and pay homage and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> This is the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Church, not which is confined within the limits of <hi>Rome,</hi> but which has the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for its conſtitutive Regent Head.</p>
               <p>And is not Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> a very pleaſant man, who would perſwade the World, that I am for ſetting up ſuch a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church in <hi>England,</hi> as the Papiſts
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:93053:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>have done at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Papiſts make it Schiſm from the Catholick Church to ſeparate from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the Head of the Church; I aſſert it to be Schiſm from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, to ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not meerly as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but as a true and ſound part of the Catholick Church, which we eſpecially are bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with: And is there no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe two?</p>
               <p>But <hi>who-ever ſeparates from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>cuts himſelf from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, puts himſelf out of a state of Salvation. He is</hi> extra Eccleſiam, extra quam nulla ſalus, <hi>they are all the while Schiſmaticks in a ſtate of Damnation:</hi> This no jeſting matter, but a ſad and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truth, which I would beg Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> as he loves his own Soul, to conſider better of at his leiſure, and out of the heat of Diſpute. Separation from the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a Schiſm, and Schiſm is as damning a ſin, as Idolatry, Drunkenneſs, or Adultery.</p>
               <p>And here he has a notable fetch. <hi>But ſurely if theſe men believed ſo much, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks they ſhould not be at reſt, until all their unſcriptural Impoſitions were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:93053:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>unleſs they have greater kindneſs for ſuch trifles, than they have for ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls for whom Christ dyed.</hi> And methinks, they ſhould be as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to take care of their own Souls, as we are to take care of them, and not to divide the Church for the ſake of ſuch Trifles, as they call them. As for removing all unſcriptural Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he calls them, by which he means the whole Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> this we cannot do without deſtroying all the external Solemnities of Worſhip, and diſſolving the Bands of Church-Society; of which more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently: And if this could be done, they would be Schiſmaticks ſtill, unleſs they could perſwade all the Churches in the World to do ſo too: For they could not maintain Catholick Communion with any Church, which uſed any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural Rites and Ceremonies, as moſt Churches in the World at this day do: Nay they would be Schiſmaticks from the Catholick Church for many hundred years before the Reformation; for their very Principles are Schiſmatical, and it is not the removing ſome few Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which would cure their Schiſm. But ſuppoſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> were
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:93053:204"/>out of their way, would that cure their Schiſm? would <hi>Presbyterians, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> and <hi>meer Anabaptiſts,</hi> cement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Communion? We know, how it has been formerly, and have reaſon to gueſs, how it would be again; when they ceaſe to be Schiſmaticks from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they will be Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks to one another.

               <p>And therefore I wonder, what our Author means, when he puts the whole Diſpute upon this iſſue: <hi>Let their terms be as Catholick, as they pretend their Church is, and we'll comply;</hi> i. e. <hi>let them keep to a few, certain, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things; let them not impoſe as terms of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, any thing but what is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word of God in Scripture,</hi>

                  <hi>we are ſatisfied, the Controverſie is at an end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a certain Argument, that our Author is no great Traveller, not ſo much as in Books; that he knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any Church, but his own dear Conventicles, unleſs he modeſtly diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles his knowledg to ſerve his Cauſe.
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:93053:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>For the terms of our Communion are as Catholick, as our Church is; Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Epiſcopacy, Liturgies, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, have been received in all Churches for many hundred years, and are the ſetled Conſtitution of moſt Churches to this day; and this is the Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the terms of our Communion; and muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be Catholick Terms, if by Catholick Terms, he means, what has actually been received by that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and not what he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ought to be made the Terms of Catholick Communion: Could Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> indeed have the new Modelling of the Catholick Church, and make what Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Terms of Communion he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>he would be ſatisfied, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie were at an end;</hi> but wiſer men conſider, that Catholick Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion are not to be made now, no more than the Catholick Faith is; and therefore it is not our private Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but the Practiſe of the Catholick Church in all Ages, which will acquaint us, what the Catholick Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion are; and he, who will not maintain Communion with the Church upon ſuch Terms, muſt be a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:93053:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>and there is an end of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
               <p>And if by <hi>according to the Word of God,</hi> he means, that nothing muſt be made a Term of Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what is agreeable to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules of Scripture, I readily grant it, and aſſert, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> requires nothing, as a Term of Communion, but what is ſo: But if he means, that the Church muſt require nothing, but what is expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Word of God, I deny, that this ever was a Term of Catholick Communion, nay nor of any particular Church-Communion; Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> himſelf rejects it, and of late, it has been thought a very great Scandal upon the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to charge them with; but it is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for a Faction to have ſome ignorant Writers, as well as Readers; for the firſt are bold, and the other credulous, and the Argument muſt be acknowledged, to be very uſeful to divide and diſturb the beſt conſtituted Church, though wiſe and cunning men are aſhamed to uſe it. And that Mr. <hi>L.</hi> means this by <hi>according to the Word of God,</hi> appears from an admirable Argument, he uſes to prove it. That we our ſelves <hi>look
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:93053:206"/>on them as indifferent,</hi> i. e. <hi>as what is not enjoyned us in the Word of God,</hi> q. d. <hi>as what is not according to the Word of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reply, p. 79.</note> Which alſo he explains by <hi>ſuch things, as are not to be found in Scripture.</hi> Now we do indeed by indifferent things, mean ſuch things, as are not commanded in Scripture, but are left to the prudence of Governors to injoyn or alter, as the Edification of the Church ſhall require; but yet we aſſert indifferent things to be according to Scripture, both as the uſe of indifferent things is allowed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as theſe particular uſages, which are enjoyned by the Church, though they may be in their own natures indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, yet are agreeable to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules of Scripture for decency and order.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> requires us <hi>to ſhew the Scriptures, that declare the things impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to be ſo neceſſary a part of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as to be a Form of our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Catholick Church; that we muſt not only ſhew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> 78.</note> 
                  <hi>that theſe things are agreeable to true Religion, but moreover that it is ſuch a neceſſary part thereof, that whoever conforms not to them, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is,</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>cut off from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:93053:206"/>
               <p>Now this were ſomething to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, did we aſſert, that the bare not doing theſe things, as for inſtance, the not wearing the Surplice, or not uſing the Croſs in Baptiſm, or not kneeling at the Sacrament, did in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> cut men off from the Catholick Church; but we never ſaid, we never thought this: But we ſay, that to ſeparate cauſeleſly from any true and ſound part of the Chriſtian Church, cuts ſuch Separatiſts off from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; and to ſeparate, where no ſinful terms of Communion are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is a cauſeleſs Separation. So that it does not lie on us to prove, that every thing that is injoyned, is in its own nature neceſſary to Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but if they would juſtifie their Separation, they muſt prove, that what is enjoyned, is ſinful.</p>
               <p>I will only ask Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> whether it be a ſufficient juſtification of Separation from any Church, that there are ſuch things impoſed, as are not indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded, but yet are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God, and to true Religion; if this be a juſt Cauſe of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, it is impoſſible, that any Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick ſhould ever want Reaſons for
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:93053:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>their Separation; for there is no Church in the World, but does ſomething or other, which they have no Command to do: If this be no ſufficient reaſon of Separation, then it is ſufficient for us to prove, that the Church impoſes nothing, but what is agreeable to true Religion, to prove them guilty of a cauſeleſs Schiſm.</p>
               <p>Can any thing be ſinful, which is agreeable to true Religion? Or can the Church ſin in commanding things which are not ſinful? If not, it is ſufficient to prove, that the Church impoſes nothing, but what is agreeable to true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For whatever juſtifies the Church, condemns the Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p>It may be, it is a harder matter than Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> is aware of, to determine, what is in its own nature abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Catholick Communion; but I can tell him, <hi>de facto,</hi> what is, <hi>viz.</hi> a Complyance with the Order, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Diſcipline and Worſhip, as well as the Doctrine of the Catholick Church; he who will not do this, muſt ſeparate from the Catholick Church, and try it at the laſt day, who was in the right; I am content, that Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> and his beloved Separatiſts, ſhould talk on
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:93053:207"/>of unſcriptural Terms of Communion, ſo they will but grant, that the Church of <hi>Englan</hi> is no more guilty of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unſcriptural Terms, than the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church it ſelf has always been; and that they ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England</hi> for ſuch Reaſons, as equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn the Catholick Church; and when they have the confidence to deny this, I will prove it, and ſhall deſire no better Vindication of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than the Practiſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> obſerves, that this is <hi>the Rule</hi> Coſterus <hi>the Jeſuit gives his young Scholar, If any object,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>where are theſe points,</hi> viz. <hi>of Invocation of Saints, the worſhipping of Images, the abstaining from Fleſh, and the like, found in Scripture, and becauſe not found in Scripture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be rejected? To which, ſaith the Jeſuit, anſwer thus: Ask, where it is forbidden in Scripture? If not forbidden in Scripture, it is no ſin to obſerve them, for where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion:</hi> But what of all this? The Rule is a very good Rule, though uſed in a bravado by the Jeſuit. Does Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> think, that Popery is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Rule, as well as indifferent
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:93053:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>and uncommanded Ceremonies? Do we ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> only for the ſake of ſome things, which are neither forbid, nor commanded in Scripture? Our Diſſenters, I ſee, have better thoughts of Popery, than the Church of <hi>England</hi> has, and are in a nearer capacity of reconciliation with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is one admirable Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, which I cannot let paſs without ſome ſhort remarks, and it is this; <hi>To make that a part of our Religion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>79.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>which is not to be found in Scripture, is to take that for a part of our Religion, which God hath not made a part thereof, which is ſinful. How much more ſo, is the making it a Term of Communion.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are as many abſurd Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons included, as can well be in ſo few words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He takes it for granted, that for the Church to require the obſervation of any thing which is not commanded in Scripture, is to make a part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of it; and yet the Church may and does enjoyn ſuch things, not as parts of Religion, but as Rules of Order and Diſcipline. Who then makes it a part of Religion? If it be made a part
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:93053:208"/>of Religion, it muſt be made ſo by God, or the Church; he acknowledges, God does not make it a part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Church declares ſhe does not, how then does it come to be a part of Religion? Or does the Church make a part of Religion againſt her own Mind, Intention, and Declaration?</p>
               <p>In ſome caſes indeed men may do, what they never intended to do, and contract a Guilt, which they utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and diſown, but then it is in ſuch caſes, where a poſitive Law, or the nature of the thing, determines the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Action, whatever he, who does it, intends by it. Thus the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts abhor the thoughts of Idolatry in the Worſhip of Saints, and Angels, and Images, and the conſecrated Hoſt, but are nevertheleſs guilty of Idolatry for that, becauſe the Law of God, and the Nature of the Worſhip makes it ſo. But now how can that come to be a part of Worſhip, which is not ſo, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a poſitive Law, nor by the Nature of the thing, nor by the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men? For is there any Law of God to make every thing a part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is commanded by the Church? If there be, the Diſpute is at
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:93053:209"/>an end; we will then own theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural Ceremonies as parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and juſtifie our ſelves, by the Command of God, and the Authority of the Church. Or can the Nature of things make that a part of Religion, which is not ſo in its own Nature? That is, can the Nature of things make an Action to be that, which in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is not? Or can the Inſtitution of the Church make that a part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which the Church never inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as a part of Religion? I would deſire Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> and his Friends to take a little time to anſwer theſe Queſtions, before they talk again of the Churches making parts of Religion and humane Sacraments, againſt her own expreſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> here ſuppoſes, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be a Term of Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but what is a neceſſary part of true Religion; for that is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Diſpute, and to make any thing a condition of Communion, he thinks, makes it a neceſſary part of true Religion: And now I begin to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what he means by Religion, or a part of Religion. Is Government and Diſcipline Religion, or a part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:93053:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>If they be, I would gladly know, Mr. <hi>Lob's</hi> definition of Religion; if they be not, are they any Terms of Communion? Or may Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and Church-Societies be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved without any Government and Diſcipline? Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> is mightily out, to think that nothing is neceſſary to Catholick Communion, but the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the true Religion; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſcipline is neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any Society, and therefore obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Eccleſiaſtical Governors is a neceſſary Duty, and a neceſſary Term of Church Communion; and let a man be never ſo ſound and orthodox in Faith and Worſhip, if he be of a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, turbulent Spirit, and diſobedient to his Governors, and their Orders and Conſtitutions, he deſerves to be flung out of Church-Communion, if he does not ſeparate himſelf, and will be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it too without Repentance. Though a very little thing may make a Schiſm, yet a Schiſm is a great and damning ſin, and the leſs the Cauſe is, the greater is the Sin. For the guilt of Schiſm and Diſobedience is not eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the intrinſick value of the thing, in which they diſobey, and for
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:93053:210"/>which they ſeparate, but according to the Nature of Schiſm and Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the ſting of all is in the Tail. He ſays, <hi>That to take that for a part of our Religion, which God hath not made a part thereof, is ſinful. How much more ſo is the making it a Term of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Which few words contain ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral very abſurd and contradictory Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and the Foundation of all is ridiculouſly falſe; the Abſurdities are notorious.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is worſe to make ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded things, Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion than parts of Worſhip; and yet the only reaſon Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> and his Friends do or can aſſign why they are unlawful Terms of Communion, is, becauſe they imagine them to be made parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; for if they be not parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, what is the evil of them? Why ſhould men ſeparate for the Surplice, or Croſs in Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> When there is no evil in theſe things? The only evil they charge them with, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that we make new Sacraments, and new parts of Worſhip by humane Authority.</p>
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:93053:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. This ſuppoſes, that that may be a part of Worſhip, which is not a Term of Communion. Otherwiſe it can be neither better nor worſe to make any thing a part of Worſhip, and a term of Communion. But this is a new Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I believe mankind was not inſtructed in before, to make that no term of Communion, which we make a part of Worſhip; which ſignifies to live in Chriſtian Communion together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an obligation to communicate in all parts of Chriſtian Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What can be more ridiculouſly abſurd and falſe, than the Foundation of all this, that the terms of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are more ſacred than the Worſhip of God. That it is a leſs Crime to make a new part of Worſhip, than a new term of Communion. That the purity of the divine Worſhip is not of that Moment and Conſequence, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Union between Chriſtians; and yet the only reaſon, why Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are to unite into one Body, is to worſhip God together? Methinks this ſhould make our new Projectors care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what they do, and make Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſeriouſly reflect, upon what he has done, who has propoſed ſuch new materials
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:93053:211"/>for Union, as were never known in the Chriſtian Church before.</p>
               <p n="11">11. His next Argument to vindicate themſelves from Schiſm, is made up, as he ſays,<note place="margin">Reply, p. 80.</note> of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s own Rule compared with his Subſtitutes notion, but the Application and Concluſion, which is the only thing conſiderable, is his own. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Rule is, that <hi>Separation is lawful, in caſe men make things indifferent neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and divide the Church upon that account.</hi> But <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my notion, makes indifferent things neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> Ergo, <hi>we may, yea, we must ſeparate, or 'tis our duty, and therefore not our ſin to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> (i.e.) <hi>we are no Schiſmaticks.</hi> Wonderful ſubtil! The Dean's Rule I own, and will ſtand to, that if men make indifferent things neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>and divide the Church upon that account,</hi> we may lawfully ſeparate from them; where the Dean makes two things neceſſary to juſtifie a Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1. That they make indifferent things neceſſary to Salvation, that is, that they aſſert the very doing of ſuch a thing to be neceſſary to Salvation, as the falſe Apoſtles aſſerted Circumciſion
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:93053:211"/>was. But yet 2. This of it ſelf is not ſufficient to juſtifie a Separation, unleſs theſe men <hi>divide the Church upon this account.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> thought fit to leave out of his Argument, becauſe it would have ſpoiled his Argument to have put it in. The bare aſſerting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things to be neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, if they do not divide the Church upon it, will not juſtifie a Separation. This many believing Jews did. They thought Circumciſion and the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> neceſſary to Salvation, and yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands Jews and Gentiles to receive each other, and to maintain one Communion; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf complyed ſometimes with them to avoid any ſcandal. But when ſome falſe Apoſtles did not only aſſert the neceſſity of ſuch things to Salvation, but would impoſe this upon all Chriſtians, or break Communion with them; when they ſeparated from the Church, it was very lawful to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from them. And therefore we muſt correct Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s Major Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus.</p>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:93053:212"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>From ſuch as make indifferent things neceſſary to Salvation, and divide the Church upon that account, we muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate. This is Dr.</hi> Stillingfleets.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider his Minor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which, he ſays, is mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Church of</hi> England <hi>makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things neceſſary to Salvation. This is the Dr's. Subſtitutes notion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God forbid! My notion, I never had ſuch a thought in my life. Well! But if Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> can prove this againſt me, I know no help for it, I'le make my Defence, as well as I can. But let us hear what he ſays.</p>
               <p>He attempts two or three ways to prove this, but blunders in each; the firſt way is this.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our Communion with the Catholick Church, is according to his Doctrine, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation.</hi> Now this I deny. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Catholick Church is neceſſary to Salvation, but whatever may be neceſſary to our Communion with the Catholick Church, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in its own nature neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It may be neceſſary in order to Catholick Communion, to comply with many inconvenient, though not ſinful terms of Communion, and all
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:93053:212"/>wiſe and good men have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to do ſo, when there is no other Remedy, does it hence follow then, that theſe good men account theſe inconvenient things neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But to proceed, <hi>But indifferent things</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>) <hi>are neceſſary to our Communion with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>which is one with the Communion with the Catholick Church, in that, according to him, they are made neceſſary to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>which is one with the Communion with the Catholick Church, according to his constant judgment.</hi> Ergo, I confeſs, what he means by this, I cannot well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; I ſuppoſe, it may be this. That I make Communion with the Catholick Church, and conſequently with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a ſound and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox part of the Catholick Church to be neceſſary to Salvation. But the obſervation of ſome indifferent things is <hi>de facto,</hi> neceſſary to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe the Church enjoyns the Obſervation of ſome indifferent things. <hi>Ergo,</hi> indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things are made neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:93053:213"/>
               <p>Now, 1. I would only ask Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> in his ear, whether his own Conſcience don't tell him, that he has prevaricated here; whether he has not uſed that term, <hi>Neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> in different ſenſes, on purpoſe to abuſe the Dean and his Subſtitute together, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon his ignorant Proſelytes. By <hi>making indifferent things neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> the Dean plainly meant, that they taught, that thoſe things, which were indeed indifferent, though not acknowledged ſo by them, had ſuch a natural and moral, or inſtituted vertue and efficacy to our Salvation, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving of them, no man can be ſaved; that they are neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as any other neceſſary and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part or duty of Religion is, the neglect of which, meerly upon account of ſuch a neglect will damn us. Now does the Dean, does his Subſtitute, does the Church of <hi>England,</hi> teach indifferent things to be neceſſary in this ſence, to have an immediate and direct influence upon our Salvation? Can any man in his wits, who owns theſe things to be indifferent, in the ſame breath aſſert them to be neceſſary in this ſenſe? And therefore Mr. <hi>Lob</hi>'s Argument is a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:93053:213"/>Sophiſm, or as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſpeaks, has four terms in it. For neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the Major Propoſition, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies very differently from neceſſary to Salvation in the Minor Propoſition; and thus the Dean and his Subſtitute are reconciled.</p>
               <p>But, 2. How ſhall I bring my ſelf off; for though I do not aſſert a direct neceſſity of indifferent things to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet I bring in a neceſſity at a back Door, and neceſſity is neceſſity, and if it be a damning neceſſity, it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of what kind and nature the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be. I make Communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi> neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and indifferent obſervances are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves neceſſary to Salvation. But yet I doubt not to make it appear, that though the Church of <hi>England</hi> does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the obſervance of ſuch indifferent things from all in her Communion, yet ſhe makes theſe things in no ſenſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In many caſes ſhe does not charge the bare not obſerving ſuch indifferent Rites with any guilt, and therefore is far enough from making them neceſſary
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:93053:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>to Salvation. Such indifferent things are not enjoyned for their own ſake, but for the ſake of publick Order and Decency; and therefore when they can be neglected without publick Scandal and Offence, without a contempt of the Government, without the guilt of Schiſm and Separation, it is no fault, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſuch by the Church. And yet did ſhe enjoyn theſe things as neceſſary to Salvation, they would equally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige in all times, and in all caſes without exception.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though Schiſm be a damning ſin; yet the impoſition of ſuch indifferent things is no neceſſary cauſe of a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Separation. Men may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in all or in moſt parts of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Worſhip with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> without aſſenting to ſuch unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Impoſitions, or yielding any active obedience to them, and I ſuppoſe, Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> will confeſs, that there is a very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difference between an active and paſſive Obedience in doubtful caſes. The terms of Lay-Communion are as eaſie, as ever they were in any ſetled and conſtituted Church; as for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Forms of Prayer, I muſt except them out of the number of indifferent
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:93053:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>things, for they have at leaſt equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and are infinitely more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, not to ſay neceſſary for publick Worſhip, than their <hi>ex tempore</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And then what is there required of a private Chriſtian to do, to qualifie him for Church-Communion; if he does not like the Surplice, he does not wear it himſelf, and let the Miniſter look to that. What hurt is it to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or their Children, to ſubmit to the Authority of the Church, in uſing the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm? They only offer their Children to be baptized; if the Miniſter does ſomething more, than what they think neceſſary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, let the Church look to that, which enjoyns it: Private Chriſtians, who have not Authority to alter publick Conſtitutions, are not concerned in that: So that there is but one Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, wherein they are required to be active, and that is, receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's Supper kneeling, which men thus peaceably diſpoſed, may eaſily be ſatisfied in the lawfulneſs and fitneſs of, and till they can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, may more innocently abſtain from the Lord's Table, and joyn in all other parts of Chriſtian Worſhip, than
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:93053:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>they can ſeparate from the Church: So that theſe indifferent things can be no juſt cauſe for any private Chriſtians to ſeparate, and if notwithſtanding they do ſeparate, and are damned for it, they muſt not charge theſe innocent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies with their Damnation. And as for thoſe, who cannot conform as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, they may, and moſt of them own they can, conform as Lay-men, and therefore theſe Ceremonies are no cauſe of their Separation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe men do take occaſion from the Diſputes and Quarrels about indifferent things, to ſeparate from the Church, and be damned for it, yet they are not damned for not obſerving ſuch indifferent Cuſtoms, though that may be the remote occaſion of it; but for their pride and ſelf-conceit, for their diſobedience to their Superiors, for their dividing the unity of the Church, and diſturbing the peace of it. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two men ſhould be ſo well employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to play at puſh-pin, and ſhould quarrel and fight, and one ſhould be killed, and the other hanged, would you ſay this man was hanged for play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at puſh-pin? Thus it is here, it is not the occaſion which peeviſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:93053:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>take to divide the Church, which muſt be charged with their Damnation, but their Pride, their Faction, their Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, their Diſobedience and ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able temper of mind, which takes ſuch ſmall occaſions to divide, and diſturb the Church. If Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> does not think this enough in anſwer to his Argument, I think, he is a little unreaſonable.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Our Author has another device ſtill to prove from my own Conceſſions, that Diſſenters are not Schiſmaticks. He ſays, that Dr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> (now two learned and reverend Prelates, whoſe bare Authority, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, is more conſiderable to me, than all our Author's Arguments) <hi>in a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Papists,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reply, p. 82.</note> 
                  <hi>aſſert, That a Superiors unjuſt caſting out of the Church, is Schiſmatical.</hi> And this I heartily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to. <hi>But according to my notion, the Church of</hi> England <hi>is guilty of ſuch impoſitions, and does unjustly excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Diſſenters.</hi> This I utterly deny. But let us hear, how Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> proves it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſays, <hi>That the Impoſitions are ſinful, is evident, in that indifferent things (as has been proved) are made neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> But I preſume the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:93053:216"/>will ſee, that this has not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved yet, and therefore it is not evident. I will only ask our Author, whether theſe reverend Biſhops by unjuſt Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, mean excommunicating thoſe, who refuſe to ſubmit to the juſt Authority of their Superiors in indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things. If they don't, as it is evident they don't, he only abuſes them, and his Readers, by their Authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates unjustly,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable, even in that the Church doth, as I would have it, by Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, caſt thouſands out of the state of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for not complying with little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded things:</hi> But now here are two great miſtakes. For, 1. The Church caſts no man out of a ſtate of Salvation, but caſts them out of her own Communion; that this excludes them from a ſtate of Salvation, is not the Act of the Church, but God's Act. The Church does not deſire, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Damnation of any man, but excommunicates them for their corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and amendment, that God would give them repentance unto life: And there may be very juſt Reaſons for the Church to excommunicate, when God,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:93053:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>who knows every circumſtance of things more particularly, than Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors can, may continue thoſe in the Communion of the inviſible Church, who are caſt out of viſible Communion. Wilful Schiſm is in all caſes a damning Schiſm, Excommunication is no ſin at all, but a ſevere puniſhment, when it is deſerved, and contracts the guilt of Schiſm, when it is deſpiſed. He who is unjuſtly caſt out of the Church, ought not to deſpiſe ſuch Cenſures, but to uſe all juſt and lawful means to be reſtored again to Communion. But the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Church, and the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Separation of Schiſmaticks, are two as different things, as can well be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. I never aſſerted, that Church-Cenſures and Excommunications always put men out of a ſtate of Salvation, but I aſſert, that wilful Schiſm does.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor does the Church excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate meerly for the ſake of <hi>ſome little uncommanded things,</hi> but for Schiſm and Church-factions, and diſobedience to Government, which are inconſiſtent with the order and preſervation of any Society, and are not the leſs ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Diſpute and Quarrel is about ſome little things. To excommunicate
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:93053:217"/>any man becauſe he will not yield to ſinful terms of Communion, <hi>i. e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not break the expreſs Laws of God, to comply with the Laws of the Church, is an unjuſt and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Excommunication; but it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the good Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Society to Excommunicate thoſe, who will not own the juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, be the thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little for which they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>For we muſt conſider, that a Church muſt firſt be Schiſmatical her ſelf, before ſhe can excommunicate Schiſmatically. Any Church, which either forbids the doing what God has commanded, or commands, what God hath forbid, is ſo far a Schiſmatick from the Catholick Church, whoſe Communion muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the divine Laws; and if ſhe excommunicates any ſingle Perſons, or Churches, for not complying with theſe unlawful and Schiſmatical terms of Communion, her Excommunications are Schiſmatical, becauſe her terms of Communion are ſo, which is the caſe of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that a Church, which is not Schiſmatical, can excommunicate Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically.</p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:93053:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>A man, who is unjuſtly excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, is caſt out of the external Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, but does not ſchiſmatically ſeparate himſelf. Nay, though he be upon other accounts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly excommunicated, if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unlawful in the Communion of that Church, (which is the unjuſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which theſe learned Biſhops aſſert to be ſchiſmatical) or he be not excommunicated upon any ſuch account, he muſt patiently bear it, and uſe all means to be reſtored, but muſt not ſet up a diſtinct and oppoſite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which would be a cauſeleſs Schiſm. For meer Excommunication, though in ſome reſpects never ſo unjuſt, is not a ſufficient reaſon to juſtifie a formed Schiſm and Separation from any Church, no more than any acts of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which private men ſuffer, will juſtifie a Rebellion againſt their Prince; God is the Judge and the Protector of oppreſſed Vertue and Innocence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſuffer from Church or State, and there only lies our laſt Appeal. So that meer Excommunication can never make any Church ſchiſmatical, or though it may occaſion, yet it can never juſtifie a Schiſm.</p>
               <pb n="418" facs="tcp:93053:218"/>
               <p>But now when any Church by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning ſinful terms of Communion, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates ſo far from the Catholick Church, and excommunicates all Perſons and Churches, who will not communicate with her in ſuch unlawful things, it is lawful and juſtifiable, nay neceſſary for ſuch Perſons to preſerve the purity of their own Communion, or to form themſelves into a diſtinct Communion in the Unity of the Catholick Church, and to leave ſuch a Church to ſtand by her ſelf: Here now is a formed Schiſm between theſe Churches, and the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, who is the Schiſmatick, the excommunicating or the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Churches. And the anſwer is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain, the excommunicating Church is the Schiſmatick, becauſe ſhe has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Catholick Communion, by impoſing unlawful terms of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>So that Excommunication can never be Schiſmatical, but when the terms of Communion are a Schiſm from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; and therefore the whole of the Diſpute comes to this, whether the enjoyning the obſervance of ſome indifferent and uncommanded Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies be a Schiſm from the Catholick
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:93053:218"/>Church; and when Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> can prove this, I will readily grant the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be ſchiſmatical, whether ſhe excommunicate Diſſenters or not. But this will be a hard matter for him to do, when the Catholick Church has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways aſſerted the Authority of the Church in theſe matters, and has always practiſed a great many uncommanded Ceremonies in all Ages; but this I have diſcourſed ſufficiently above.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, how Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> fails in his new attempts, to prove the Church of <hi>England</hi> the Schiſmatick from my own Principles and Conceſſions. Let us now conſider, how he juſtifies his old Argument to prove the Church the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and certainly never any man was more hard put to it, to make ſome little inſignificant appearance of an Anſwer, than he was, and yet he puts a very good face on it, and with a brave Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, huffs it off, as if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid that deſerved an Anſwer. And I confeſs, it abundantly ſatisfies me, what a vain attempt it is, to convince men, who are reſolved, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd.</p>
               <pb n="420" facs="tcp:93053:219"/>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> or any other for him will give a fair and particular Anſwer to thoſe few Pages in the Defence, from p. 22. to p. 53. I promiſe them to be their Convert, and a zealous oppoſer of all indifferent Ceremonies in Religion. But becauſe Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> would have the World believe, that he has done this already, I ſhall deſire my Readers to look over thoſe few Pages in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and compare them with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; and if this could be obtained, I would venture to leave it, juſt as it is without any further remarks. But leaſt he ſhould boaſt, that I decline the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, I ſhall briefly conſider, what deſpicable Arts he uſes to impoſe upon his Readers.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> undertook to prove the Church, not the Diſſenter, to be the divider by this Argument. <hi>The Church without ſin can part with their indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Ceremonies, but Diſſenters without ſin cannot comply with them; what then muſt be done for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion? Muſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal comply in things, wherein they can without ſin? Or muſt the Diſſenters ſin and looſe their Peace with God for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> And a little after, he adds; <hi>This is the ſtate of the Caſe, the Diſſenters would
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:93053:219"/>unite, but cannot, the Epiſcopals can, but will not. The cannot of the Diſſenters, and the Epiſcopals will not, doth make the diviſion; but who is the faulty Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vider? If the true reaſon of our diviſion lay on the Diſſenters will not, when they can, 'twould be eaſie to conclude them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and perverſe</hi> (that is, in plain <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> Schiſmaticks) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>not to do, what they can for Peace? But ſince they would, but cannot without ſin, how can they be the Dividers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I ſhewed particularly,<note place="margin">Defence, p. 27. &amp;c.</note> was <hi>all trick and fallacy. When he ſays, the Church without ſin can part with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Ceremonies; if by the Church he means any thing leſs than the King and Parliament, it is falſe. For all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergy in</hi> England <hi>cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin part with theſe indifferent Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, till the Law enacting them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed. And if by indifferent Ceremonies he means Dioceſan Epiſcopacy and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, as it is plain he does, the Church of</hi> England <hi>does not account theſe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ceremonies, nor think, ſhe can part with them without ſin. And when he ſays, that the Diſſenters without ſin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comply with them; if by without ſin he means without breaking ſome divine
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:93053:220"/>Law, it is falſe; for there is no Law to forbid our obedience to Civil and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Governors in indifferent things: If he means, that they must act contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Conſcience, that is, their own Opinion and Judgment of things, they may be the Dividers and Schiſmaticks for all that; unleſs we will ſay, that no man, but a profligate Knave, who ſins againſt his Conſcience, can be a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus as <hi>for his will not and cannot. If by the Epiſcopals will not, he means, that they will not do, what they may by divine and humane Laws, and with a juſt reſpect to the good Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Edification of the Church, and regular Administration of holy Offices, they are faulty in it, but may be no Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks notwithstanding, ſo long as they exact no ſinful terms of Communion: and if by the Diſſenters cannot, he means their private Opinions and Perſwaſions, which hinder their Complyance, they may be the Dividers still, if their perſwaſions be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this and a great deal more our Author paſſes over very wiſely without the leaſt notice; but to convince him of the Sophiſtry of this Argument, I
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:93053:220"/>propoſed another like it, which as fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt the Schiſm upon the Diſſenter, as his did upon the Church; and it was this: <hi>If the Diſſenters can without ſin obey their Governors in indifferent, that is, in lawful things, but will not; and the Epiſcopal would be content to part with indifferent things for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, but cannot; who is the faulty Divider? What must be done for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion? Must the Diſſenters comply in things, wherein they can without ſin? Or muſt the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ſin, and loſe their Peace with God for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion?</hi> And I added, <hi>I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our Inquirer to think better of it, and anſwer this Argument if he can, without ſhewing the Sophistry of his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> it ſeems, had enough of his own Argument, and durſt not venture his Readers with it a ſecond time; but he repeats my Argument by it ſelf, without taking notice upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it was urged, which muſt needs make it look oddly; only wonders, why I call this an Argument, and that I ſhould ſay, that <hi>this cannot be anſwered without a ſhewing Sophiſtry to be,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reply, p. 87.</note> 
                  <hi>where it is not.</hi> So that it is plain, that he durſt not let his Readers know, that he had made any Argument like this, or
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:93053:221"/>that this had any relation to his own way of reaſoning, but turns it off with, <hi>without a ſhewing Sophiſtry, where it is not,</hi> inſtead of let him <hi>anſwer this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, if he can without ſhewing the Sophiſtry of his own.</hi> It is apparent, Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> was here convinc'd, that he had reaſoned fooliſhly, but had not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and ingenuity to own it. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the fallacy of both theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſiſts in the different accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>cannot,</hi> and <hi>will not;</hi> in one ſence, they may be turned againſt the Church, in another ſence againſt the Diſſenter, with equal force and truth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without a more particular expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe ambiguous terms, it is a good Argument againſt neither; which muſt needs make it a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant entertainment to any man, who underſtands the Laws of reaſoning, to ſee Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> ſo gravely confute my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument without taking any notice of his own; when all that I pretended was, that this was as good an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Diſſenters, as his was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church, and were both to be anſwered the ſame way, by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the different ſignifications of thoſe terms, as I have ſhewed above.</p>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:93053:221"/>
               <p>But that this Inquirer might not ſay, that I had uſed ſome Art to wave the Diſpute, but had not anſwered his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I granted him his own ſence of the Words, and reduced the force of his Argument to theſe two Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 1. <hi>That all things, which are in their own nature indifferent, may without ſin be parted with:</hi> 2. <hi>That the Opinion of Diſſenters, that indifferent things are unlawful in the Worſhip of God, is a juſt reaſon for parting with them.</hi> The firſt I diſcourſed at large from this Topick, <hi>That there can be no publick and ſolemn Worſhip, no face or appearance of any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline or Government in the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of ſome ſuch indifferent things. For all actions muſt be cloathed with ſome ſuch external Circumſtances, as though they are not eſſential to the moral nature of the Action, yet are neceſſary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal performance of it:</hi> Which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at large in the Defence.<note place="margin">Defence, p. 30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> All that Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> replies to this, is, that the force of his Argument does not lie in this, <hi>That all things which are in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferent, may without ſin be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with.</hi> How then will he prove, <hi>that the Church without ſin may part with her indifferent Ceremonies,</hi> if every thing,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:93053:222"/>that is indifferent may not be parted with without ſin? I can think of no other way to prove this; if he can, I ſhall be glad to hear it. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then does the force of his Argument conſiſt? Why he tells us it is this:<note place="margin">Reply, p. 85.</note> 
                  <hi>That no one indifferent Ceremony must be made ſo neceſſary a part of Religion, as to be a term of Communion.</hi> Though I doubt, he would be troubled to apply this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition dexterouſly to the proof of his Argument, yet to make as few Diſputes as may be, we will ſuppoſe the force of his Argument to lie here, and does not this come much to one? Muſt not the Church part with any indifferent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which any Diſſenter is pleaſed to diſlike, if ſhe muſt not make any one Ceremony a Term of Communion? And if all indifferent things muſt not, cannot be parted with without ſin, then ſome indifferent things may be made the terms of Communion.</p>
               <p>But here are two things Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily or ignorantly inſinuates, which muſt not paſs without remark. 1. He will not venture his Argument meerly upon indifferent things, he has had enough of that already, but on making indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things neceſſary parts of Religion,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:93053:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>whereas the Church of <hi>England</hi> makes them no part of Religion at all. They are not neceſſary to the moral nature of any religious Action, but to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal performance of it, as I ſhewed at large. 2. He inſinuates a proof of this, that theſe indifferent things are made neceſſary parts of Religion, becauſe they are made <hi>terms of Communion.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the terms of Communion are of two forts, either the eſſentials of Faith and Worſhip, and what is in this ſence made a term of Communion, is indeed a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part of Religion; but the Church of <hi>England</hi> never made indifferent things terms of Communion in this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, but does expreſly declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. But, 2. The external Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Worſhip, and the Rules of Decency and Order are terms of Communion alſo, becauſe ſome ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Circumſtances or Ceremonies of Worſhip, are neceſſary to the external ſolemnities and decency of Worſhip; and it is fit, that they ſhould not be left at liberty, but determined by the publick Authority of the Church, and of the State in a Chriſtian Kingdom, to which all private Chriſtians are bound to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as I diſcourſed in the Defence. But
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:93053:223" rendition="simple:additions"/>the great difficulty ſeems to lie here, that any man ſhould be denied the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Chriſtian Communion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the ordinary means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for not complying with ſome indifferent things, which God has no where commanded, and which no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian had been bound to obſerve, had they not been commanded by the Church, which ſeems to make theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things as neceſſary, as the moſt ſubſtantial parts of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Now as great as this difficulty may ſeem to be, it is but turning the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and there are as great difficulties on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>For, 1. It is as unaccountable to me, that any Chriſtian ſhould exclude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Communion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and the ordinary means of Salvation, for ſuch things, as have neither any moral evil in them, nor are forbid by any poſitive Law of God, which makes the not doing ſuch things to be more neceſſary than the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, or the Worſhip of God it ſelf. Now, 1. Is not every man as accountable to God for his own Soul, as the Church is? 2. Has any man any more warrant for excluding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:93053:223"/>from Chriſtian Communion, for not doing what God has not forbid, than the Church has for caſting them out of Communion, for not obſerving ſome innocent Rites and Uſages, though not commanded by God? For, 3. Is it not a greater encroachment on the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power and Prerogative to make that unlawful, which God has not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, than it is to enjoyn the obſervance of that, which God has not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? The firſt alters the nature of things, makes that ſinful, which God has not made ſinful. The ſecond only determins the circumſtances of Action, which God had not determined, but left to the Determination of humane Prudence, or Eccleſiaſtical Authority. And, 4. Which is likely to be the beſt juſtification, the Opinion of a private man in oppoſition to the Authority, and to the diſturbance of the Peace and Communion of the Church, or the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Judgment and Authority of the Church in preſerving her own Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government, and cenſuring obſtinate and diſorderly Members. Let Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> conſider, how to juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in making that unlawful, which God has not forbid, and ſeparating from
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:93053:224" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Communion of the Church for that reaſon, and I will more eaſily juſtifie the Church in denying Communion to thoſe, who refuſe to comply with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, but uncommanded Rites.</p>
               <p>But, 2. This Difficulty is the ſame in all Communions, as well as in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Neither <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> nor <hi>Independents,</hi> will allow diſorderly Members in their Communion, who will not ſubmit to the Conſtitutions of their ſeveral Churches; and thereby they make the Peculiarities of their Churches neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terms of their Communion. They will no more ſuffer a man to receive the Sacrament kneeling, nor to pray in a Surplice, nor to baptize with the ſign of the Croſs in their Churches, than the Church of <hi>England</hi> will ſuffer her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to neglect theſe Ceremonies; and therefore they make the not doing ſuch indifferent things as neceſſary terms of Communion, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> does the doing of them, and do as ſtrictly enjoyn Conformity to their own way and modes of Worſhip, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> does to hers, and therefore the Church may as eaſily defend her ſelf from this difficulty, as the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles can.</p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:93053:224"/>
               <p>But the bare retorting of a difficulty does not anſwer it, though ſuch men ought in modeſty to be ſilent, till they can anſwer for themſelves, and then they will be aſhamed to urge this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Church: And it is a ſign, ſuch men think but of one ſide, who uſe ſuch Arguments againſt their Adverſaries, as recoil upon themſelves. But indeed the Difficulty it ſelf, when it is fairly ſtated is no difficulty, as will appear in theſe following Propoſitions, ſome of which are already proved in the Defence; and therefore to ſave my ſelf the trouble of tranſcribing, I ſhall only direct my Reader, where to find them proved.</p>
               <p>The Difficulty is, why thoſe things, which are acknowledged to be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, ſhould be ſo ſtrictly enjoyned, as to exclude thoſe from Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who will not, or cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them. Now to this I anſwer by theſe ſteps.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſome things,<note place="margin">Defence, p. 30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their own nature, are yet neceſſary ſolemnities of Worſhip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the publick Worſhip of God cannot be performed at all, or can have no face or appearance of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:93053:225"/>as I have proved in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Peace,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 44, 45</note> and Order, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, and the due care of the divine Worſhip, requires, that the external Circumſtances of publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould be determined, and not left to the choice of every private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Since ſome external Circumſtances and Solemnities of Worſhip muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and yet are not determined by any poſitive Law of God, it is plain, that they are left to the determination of the publick Authority of the Church, which muſt determine all private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. For every thing of a publick nature, wherein a whole Society is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, muſt be determined and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by publick Authority, or no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety can ſubſiſt. Every private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. in his private Capacity may chooſe for himſelf; every Maſter of a Family may and ought to chooſe for his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as far as concerns the Government of it; and the ſupreme Authority of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Society muſt chooſe for the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. For how is it poſſible, there ſhould be any decency or uniformity of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, any Order or Government main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:93053:225"/>in the Church, if it is in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of every private Chriſtian to make the moſt wholſom Conſtitutions of a Church, unlawful and ſinful Impoſitions by his private diſſent, and obſtinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of Obedience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it be lawful for the publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, to determine the indifferent Circumſtances, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Solemnities of Worſhip, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make them the terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; that is, it can't be avoided, but it muſt be ſo. For when the Church determines the indifferent and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Circumſtances of Worſhip, all that is meant by it, is, that ſhe requires all in her Communion to worſhip God in ſuch a manner, which is the only ſence, wherein indifferent things are, or can be made the terms of Communion. So that the Controverſie muſt return, where it firſt began, about the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of indifferent Circumſtances, and Ceremonies of Worſhip, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Church to determine them; for making them terms of Communion is no new difficulty, for it ſignifies no more than preſcribing ſuch a way of worſhipping God; and if it be lawful for the Church to preſcribe the Modes
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:93053:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Circumſtances of Worſhip, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miſtake in making them terms of Communion.</p>
               <p>For, 5. If the Church have Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to preſcribe the Order and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of publick Worſhip, it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to think, that ſhe may not juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny thoſe her Communion, who will not ſubmit to her Authority, and comply with her Orders and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Which is to ſay, that ſhe has Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that ſhe has none. For it is ſufficiently known, that the Church, as ſuch, has no other Authority, but to receive in, or to ſhut out of her Communion; and if ſhe cannot aſſiſt her commanding Authority, with her Authority of Cenſures, it is little worth.</p>
               <p>Nay, 6. In the nature of the thing it cannot be otherwiſe. Thoſe, who will not conform to the Conſtitutions of the Church, muſt forſake her Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, for there is no other way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to be had there. And therefore we need enquire no further, than whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawful for the Church to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a form of Worſhip to her ſelf; if it be, ſhe needs exerciſe no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; for thoſe, who will not conform
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:93053:226"/>to it, will ſeparate themſelves without her Authority. And as for the ſin and danger of Schiſm, let the Church look to her ſelf, that ſhe give no juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it, and let ſcrupulous and tender Conſciences look to themſelves, that they take no unjuſt Offence; and this is the only remedy I know of in this caſe, without proſtituting Church-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the Worſhip of God, to a blind and factious Zeal. And yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, no Church is bound to own thoſe of her Communion, who ſeparate from her Worſhip, and deſpiſe her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And whereas Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> founds his Objection upon making <hi>indifferent things</hi> terms of Communion, every one, who underſtands the nature of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, knows, that it is an unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able miſchief, to diſturb and diſſolve humane Societies, though for very little things. Schiſm is a very great evil; and nevertheleſs becauſe the Diſpute is about indifferent things, the preſervation of the Peace and Unity of the Church, the decency and ſolemnities of Worſhip, and the ſacredneſs of Authority, is neceſſary to Chriſtian Communion, without which the Church muſt diſſolve and
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:93053:227"/>disband into private Conventicles, as we ſee at this day; and therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſturbs Chriſtian Communion for indifferent things, does as well deſerve to be caſt out of the Church, as the moſt profligate ſinners. But to return to Mr. <hi>Lob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The only Objection he has againſt all that I urged in the Defence, is, that I run from Circumſtances to Ceremonies, and yet his Conſcience tells him, if ever he read the Defence,<note place="margin">Defence, p. 38.</note> that he knows the contrary; for I particularly anſwered that Objection in the Defence, and it ſeems, I have ſo anſwered it, that Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> thought it the wiſer courſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his knowledg of any ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, than to attempt any Reply to it.</p>
               <p>And now let any man judge, what an unreaſonable task Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> has put on me.<note place="margin">Reply, p. 84.</note> 
                  <hi>It lies on him</hi> (ſays he) <hi>either to prove to our Conviction, that we may without ſin comply with their Impoſition,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>he muſt ſo far effectually enlighten our Conſciences, as to help us to ſee, that the Impoſitions are not ſinful, and that we may lawfully conform.</hi> But how is this poſſible for me, or any other man to do, when he will not ſo much as ſee, what
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:93053:227"/>we ſhew him? When he is ſo far from an impartial Examination of the Reaſon of what is propoſed, that he will not ſo much as own, that it was ever propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. It is not in our Power to give him eyes, or to make him open his eyes, when he wilfully ſhuts them. Much leſs do we deſire, as he proceeds, <hi>That they ſhould conform againſt their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and yield a blind obedience to ſuch Commands;</hi> we have had too much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of ſuch conſciencious men in the Church already, who have conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt their Conſciences, that they might raiſe a Church of <hi>England</hi>-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, as this Author impudently ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, and takes the firſt opportunity to pull down the Church, and to expiate their ſins of Conformity by a thorough Reformation. There is ſomething lies on them to do, as well as on us; and that is freely and impartially to conſider, what is offered for their Conviction; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg themſelves convinc'd, when they are convinc'd; to prefer the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their own Souls, and the Peace of the Church, before private Fame, or ſerving a Party; that is, in a word, to be honeſt, and then there will be no need for the Church to part with her Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:93053:228"/>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing wherein I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the force of his Argument lay, was this: <hi>That the Opinion of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, that indifferent things are unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Worſhip of God, is a just and neceſſary Reaſon for parting with them.</hi> Now he does not take notice of any one word of Anſwer I return to this, nay, does not ſo much, as repreſent the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why I place the force of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this, which is, that <hi>if the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Diſſenters, that all indifferent things are unlawful, be not a ſufficient Reaſon for parting with them, then there may be no fault in the Epiſcopals</hi> will not, <hi>or a ſufficient juſtification or excuſe in the Diſſenters</hi> cannot. Inſtead of which, he ſays, I give this Reaſon for it; <hi>if it be not lawful to part with every thing that is indifferent, thoſe who retain the uſe of</hi> (<hi>ſome,</hi> which he leaves out) <hi>indifferent things, cannot meerly upon that account, be called Dividers or Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> which does not refer to the ſecond, but to the firſt thing, wherein I placed the force of his Argument. <hi>That all things, which are in their own nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, may without ſin be parted, with.</hi> Certainly never any man was in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turmoil and confuſion of thoughts,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:93053:228"/>than Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> appears to have been in all this time, when he was reſolved to anſwer, but knew not what to ſay. No man, I fear, need convince Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> that he may conform againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Make it but his Intereſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and his Conſcience ſeems ready prepar'd.</p>
               <p>Well, but however, that he might ſeem to return ſome Anſwer to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of that Principle, that <hi>the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Diſſenters, that indifferent things are unlawful in the Worſhip of God, is a juſt and neceſſary Reaſon for the Church to part with them;</hi> he juſt names it, and then picks ſome Quarrels with what I had ſaid upon the firſt thing, <hi>that all indifferent things cannot be parted with, without ſin,</hi> and this muſt paſs for an Anſwer to the ſecond. And how is it poſſible <hi>to enlighten</hi> ſuch a man as this?</p>
               <p>But let us hear, what he ſays. <hi>You ſhould remember, that I distinguiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Ceremonies and Circumſtances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what is a part of Religion, and intrinſecal thereunto, and what is extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal only. But you run to external Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that are neceſſary in theſe; which is off from the point in hand.</hi> Had
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:93053:229"/>I done ſo, I believe Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> would not have been ſo ſparing of Paper, as not to have ſhewn his Readers, how I did it. But I have already anſwered that Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and directed my Readers where they may find the contrary, if they dare believe their own eyes.</p>
               <p>But he ſays,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 85.</note> 
                  <hi>I run from what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, to what is neceſſary, as if we call'd you to part with any neceſſary thing.</hi> This is another trick. The caſe is this: He charges the Church of <hi>England</hi> with being the Divider, becauſe ſhe does not part with indifferent things, which ſhe may part with without ſin. I prove, that though no particular indifferent Ceremony can be ſaid to be neceſſary, for then it were no longer indifferent, yet ſome indifferent things are neceſſary to publick Worſhip, not to the moral Nature, but the external performance of Religious Actions, and therefore all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things cannot be parted with without deſtroying publick Worſhip; and yet if we muſt part with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, meerly conſidered as indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, by the ſame Reaſon we muſt be obliged to part with all. This he calls running from what is indifferent, to what is neceſſary; whereas it only
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:93053:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>proves, that ſome things, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their own Natures, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to publick Worſhip, which was very much to my purpoſe, though not to his.</p>
               <p>I gave an Inſtance of this in ſome Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which cannot poſſibly be ſtript from all external Circumſtances. As <hi>a man, who is to travel from</hi> London <hi>to</hi> York, <hi>is not bound either to go thither on Foot, or to ride on Horſe-back, or in a Coach, each of theſe ways are in themſelves indifferent; but yet if he will travel to</hi> York, <hi>he muſt uſe one or other of theſe ways of Motion, not any one in particular is neceſſary, but yet ſome or other is.</hi> But ſays Mr. <hi>Lob, One has not ſtrength to walk,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 86.</note> another cannot bear riding in a Coach, yet to</hi> York <hi>they must go. If you will keep to your point, you must ſay to him, that can't walk, ſome way of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neceſſary to your going to</hi> York, <hi>if you'l go thither, therefore you ſhall walk, or not go thither.</hi> The force of which Anſwer amounts to this, that every man muſt be left at liberty to chooſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Circumſtances of Worſhip for himſelf, as he is to chooſe his own way of Travelling, whether on Foot, or by Horſe, or Coach. But this alſo, I had
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:93053:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>particularly conſidered, and anſwered in the Defence, though our Inquirer is pleaſed to take no notice of it, and I ſuppoſe, ſhould I repeat what I have ſaid, he will take as little notice of it the ſecond time, as he has done the firſt. The Inquiſitive Reader may find dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Margin,<note place="margin">Defence, p. 44.</note> where to ſeek for an Anſwer to it. And if Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think of ſome better Defence, he and his beloved Diſſenters muſt be the Dividers and Schiſmaticks ſtill.</p>

               <p>THE laſt thing I propoſed to my ſelf for the Concluſion of this Work, was to examine Mr. <hi>Lob's</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and Mr. <hi>H's</hi> Materials for Union: But this Vindication is already much larger, than I intended it, and I find this Work done very ſufficiently by Mr. <hi>Long,</hi> in a late Treatiſe, Entitled, <hi>No Protestant, but the Diſſenters Plot;</hi> and therefore though it were eaſie to enlarge upon this Subject, I ſhall make but ſome
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:93053:230"/>brief Remarks upon the Materials for Union, and refer thoſe who are inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, for further ſatisfaction to the forementioned Treatiſe. And I ſhall only obſerve theſe four things in Mr. <hi>H's.</hi> project: 1. That it deſtroys the preſent Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> 2. That it ſets up no Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church in the room of it. 3. That it cures no Schiſm. 4. That it is not a likely way ſo much as to preſerve ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Peace and Union in the Nation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe Materials for Union deſtroy the preſent Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and is not this a modeſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal in a Diſſenter, to pull down the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is eſtabliſhed by Law, and is owned by the greateſt and moſt conſiderable part of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make way for Union? Does Mr. <hi>H.</hi> imagine, that the true Sons of the Church, will ſo eaſily part with ſo anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Apoſtolical a Government, which owes not its Inſtitution to Civil Powers?

To attempt a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:93053:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>on between Diſſenters, who, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> owns, can never agree their Diſputes, and therefore can never unite, though they may be tied together, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the ſame Veſſel, as Sand or Water is, and to diſſolve a Church, which is all of a piece, firmly united within it ſelf, and to its Prince?</p>
               <p>But what need all this? Will Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſay, I never deſigned to diſſolve the Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but only to bring Diſſenters into the legal Eſtabliſhment. Let this then be tried, whether his Materials for Union do not deſtroy the preſent Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Root and Branch.</p>
               <p>The preſent Conſtitution of our Church, in Conformity to the Ancient Apoſtolical Government, conſiſts of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons; let us try then, whether we can find either of theſe in Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Materials for Union.</p>
               <p>As for Deacons, he has not one word of them, though Mr. <hi>Lob.</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, they were owned for an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Order by the neceſſary Erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but a great Oracle thinks, this Order may be ſpared, though it has been continued in the Church ever ſince the Apoſtles days, and therefore we will let this paſs.</p>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:93053:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But we muſt not deny, but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> owns Biſhops, nay, propoſes, that ſome leading Diſſenters themſelves ſhould be made the next Biſhops; and that his Project <hi>ſhall advance, and not leſſen the outward Power and Honour of Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſtill we muſt have a care not to be cheated with a Name, inſtead of the thing. Are Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Biſhops true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Biſhops, as the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are? Otherwiſe he may retain the Name of Biſhops, and yet deſtroy the Epiſcopacy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the plain truth of the Caſe. Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Biſhops are not Biſhops of the Church, but <hi>the King's Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Officers acting</hi> circa ſacra, <hi>only by vertue of his Authority and Commiſſion.</hi> And therefore can exerciſe no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church, than the King can, which is not the Authority of a Biſhop. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s Biſhops may be Lay-men, as well as Eccleſiaſticks; for though called Biſhops, they cannot do any one Act of a primitive Biſhop. They have no Eccleſiaſtical Superiority over their Clergy, but what the King has, which uſed to be diſtinguiſh'd from the Authority of the Biſhop. They have
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:93053:232"/>not the Power of Ordination, nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation as the King's Biſhops, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may have as Congregational Biſhops, for the King has no Power to ordain or confirm. They cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate as Biſhops, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſerts, <hi>That as the Magiſtrate does not take away or invade, but preſerve the Power of the Keys (invested in the Minister, but given with the Pastor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Church) no more can the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſans that derive from him, aſſume it to themſelves, and deprive the particular Churches of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſince Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Biſhops have no proper Eccleſiaſtical Authority, it is no wonder, that they have no body to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; for theſe are all ſuch Dioceſan Biſhops, as have no Presbyters under them, every Congregational Miniſter being a Congregational Biſhop, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> owns.<note place="margin">Defence, p. 260. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Theſe things I diſcourſed at large in the Defence, and all that I am concerned for now, is to obſerve, how charitable Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is to the Church of <hi>England</hi> in his Materials for Union, for he leaves the Church neither Biſhops, Presbyters, nor Deacons. If they can talk at this Rate, when they cry out of Perſecution, and pretend to Petition
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:93053:232"/>for Peace, what may we expect from them, if they ſhould be rampant once more? We ſee they are the ſame men that ever they were, when they cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted againſt Root and Branch; and have the Impudence at this time a day, when they plead for Peace and Union, for Toleration and Comprehenſion, or other nameleſs Models, to make Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals for comprehending or tolerating any thing but the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Upon theſe terms we may be at peace, and unite with Diſſenters, if we will ſacrifice, not meerly ſome indifferent Ceremonies, (though they make a great noiſe about them, as if they were the only Impediments) but the Church of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf to Peace and Unity; which I hope will open mens eyes at length to ſee, what theſe men would be at, and I pray God it may be, before it be too late.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Materials for Union overthrows the preſent Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo it ſets up no National Church in the room of it. This is his great deſign, I confeſs, to make a National Church of all the divided and ſeparated Congregations in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which he thinks may be done by
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:93053:233"/>the vertue of an Act of Parliament. <hi>I would</hi> (ſays he) <hi>have all our Aſſemblies that are tolerable, to be made legal by ſuch an Act, and thereby parts of the National Church, as well as the Parochial Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</hi> But though the Power of an Act of Parliament, I confeſs, is very great, yet it cannot reconcile Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, nor make Diviſion to be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor a great many Schiſmatical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, which divide from one another, to be one Church. For a Church is a Communion of Chriſtians, a Parochial Congregation is a Parochial Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Dioceſan Church is a Dioceſan Communion, a National Church, is a National Communion, and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, is one Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as I have proved at large in the Defence, but Communion is always eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the notion of a Church, of what denomination ſoever. Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Parliament ſhould by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Presbyterian, and Independent Churches of all ſorts, as well as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet how can an Act of Parliament make them all one Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion, when after ſuch an Act, they would remain as much divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſeparated from one another, and
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:93053:233"/>from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as they are now, and the deſign of ſuch an Act of Parliament is, to make it lawful or legal for them to continue ſo.</p>
               <p>Are the Presbyterian and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Congregations one Communion with themſelves, or with the Church of <hi>England</hi> now? If they be, why do they complain for want of Union? If they be not, will ſuch an Act of Parliament which eſtabliſhes the Schiſm, and makes it a Law, make them unite into one Communion? No man knows indeed, what may be, becauſe theſe men love to act in contradiction to Laws, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may grow out of love with Schiſm, when it is made the Law of the Land; but if they do not, how are they more united into one Communion by ſuch a Law, than they are without it? If their Churches, Government, Diſcipline, Worſhip, be all diſtinct, and ſeparate, and contrary to each other, what a ſtrange kind of Communion is this? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Member of the National Church, is a Member of the whole National Church; but can a Presbyterian, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, or Epiſcopal Church be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one another? By what name ſhall we call this Monſter? It is neither
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:93053:234"/>an Independent, Presbyterian, nor E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Church, but one National Church which conſiſts of as heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous parts, as <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>'s Image, or like ſome monſtrous Birth, with the Head of a man, the Paws of a Bear, and the Tail of a Serpent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſinit in piſcem mulier formoſa ſuperne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Act of Parliament may give a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal eſtabliſhment to all theſe divided Churches, as the Popiſh and Proteſtant Churches of <hi>France,</hi> are both eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Laws of the Land; but does this make <hi>French</hi> Papiſts and Proteſtants to be one National Church? Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Principles muſt aſſert them both to be but one National Church, but he will have but little thanks for it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Papiſts, nor Proteſtants. Not from Papiſts, who call the <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Schiſmaticks, and therefore do not own them to be any part of their National Church; nor from the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who do as much abhor to be thought Members of the Popiſh Church; and yet this is ſuch a legal National Church, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> contends for, united under one Prince, who, according to his Principles, is <hi>the accidental Head of this accidental National Church,</hi> and yet
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:93053:234"/>this Union does not cure the Schiſm; for they ſtill are two diſtinct and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Churches, and are accounted Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks to each other.</p>
               <p>There are but two or three things, ſo far as I can obſerve, whereon Mr. <hi>H.</hi> founds this National Union between all theſe divided and ſeparate Churches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they are all united under the King, as the <hi>constitutive Regent Head of the National Church.</hi> And this, I grant, makes them <hi>all legal Churches,</hi> as he ſpeaks, or <hi>legal parts of the Church,</hi> but it does not make them one Church. You may as well ſay, that <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> are one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, becauſe they are united under one Prince; or that all the Corporations in <hi>England</hi> are one National Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they have diſtinct Charters, and different Priviledges and Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Nothing is National, but what extends to the whole Nation, and where ſeveral Churches are eſtabliſhed by Law, there can be no one National Church, though they be all under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame Prince, becauſe there is no one Church-Conſtitution, for all the Churches in the Nation to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by; which is the notion of a
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:93053:235"/>National Church in the ſenſe we now ſpeak of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another way of uniting all theſe ſeparate Churches, is by the King's Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Officers, whom he calls Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who have an equal ſuperviſing care of them all. <hi>Their work in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral being to ſuperviſe the Churches of both ſorts in their Dioceſſes, that they all walk according to their own Order, agreeable to the Goſpel, and to the Peace of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi> Now that this cannot make them one National Church, will appear from theſe Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That theſe Biſhops, though they may be Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, yet are not properly Eccleſiaſtical, but Civil Officers, they act not by an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority, but are Miniſters of the Regal Power in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, as I have already ſhewn; and therefore if their Union under one Prince, cannot make them one Church, much leſs can their Union under the King's Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe they were true Primitive Biſhops, yet where there are ſeparate Churches in any Dioceſs, they cannot all live in Communion with their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and therefore cannot be one Church. For Communion with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:93053:235"/>is eſſential to the notion and unity of an Epiſcopal Church, as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Defence.<note place="margin">Defence, p 469. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> A ſuperviſing Power, not to govern the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Judgment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but to ſee, that they govern themſelves according to their own Forms and Models, is no Epiſcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, much leſs any Act of Church-Communion. Thoſe only communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with their Biſhop, who ſubmit to his Paſtoral Authority, and partake with him in all Religious Offices, and thoſe who do not, according to the notion of the Catholick Church, are Schiſmaticks, and therefore not of the ſame Church with him. It is a very different thing to be a meer Viſitor and a Biſhop, and it is as different a thing to be in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a Biſhop, and to be ſubject to the Viſitations of the King's Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Miniſter; and therefore a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing Power cannot make thoſe one Church, who are of different Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Project ſhould take, to make ſome leading Diſſenters Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, it is ſtill more evident, that they could in no ſenſe make a National Church, becauſe the Biſhops of the
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:93053:236"/>Church would be of different Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, For it is the Communion of Biſhops with one another, which unite all their Churches into a National, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> cap. 7. 8.</note> or Catholick Church, as I have proved in the Defence. This is abundantly enough to ſhew, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Epiſcopal Viſiters, cannot make a National Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another way Mr. <hi>H.</hi> propoſes, to unite all theſe Churches into one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church, is by the Vertue of <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Communion. That when a man hath his choice to be of one Church, which he will, in regard to fixed Communion, he ſhould occaſionally come alſo to the other, for maintaining this National <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, 1. No occaſional Acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion can unite Churches of diſtinct and ſeparate Communions. To be in Communion with a Church, is to be a member of it; no man ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with any Church, of which he is not a Member, and no Acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion can unite Churches, which do not make them Members of each other, as I have alſo proved in the Defence; and therefore ſuch occaſional Acts of Communion,<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p 132,</hi> &amp;c</note> can contribute nothing to a National Union.</p>
               <pb n="455" facs="tcp:93053:236"/>
               <p n="2">2. Of what nature ſhall this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Communion be? Shall they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in all Acts of Worſhip, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear a Sermon now and then toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? If in all Acts of Worſhip, why ſhould there be diſtinct Communions at any time? Why cannot he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate always with that Church, with which he can communicate in all Acts of Worſhip ſome times? If our occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Communion be only in ſome few leſs material Acts, this makes no Union of Churches; for if there be any Acts of Worſhip, wherein they can at no time communicate with each other, no man will ſay ſuch Churches are united in one Communion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What is the meaning of this <hi>ſhould:</hi> would Mr. <hi>H.</hi> have an Act of Parliament to enjoyn this occaſional Communion; and what will this differ from an Act of Uniformity? For it requires Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſometimes, and if Uniformity be ſometimes lawful, why ſhould it not be made always neceſſary? If Mr. <hi>H.</hi> by <hi>ſhould</hi>— only intimates, what he would have them do, what then, if they won't, notwithſtanding his <hi>ſhould?</hi> What will become of this National Union then? This occaſional Communion is either
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:93053:237"/>neceſſary to this National Union, or it is not. If it be not neceſſary, why does Mr. <hi>H.</hi> make this an expedient for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Union? If it be, how will he prove, that all Diſſenters will occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally communicate with each other, and with the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. H.'s project for Union, will cure no one Schiſm, and therefore can make no Union. This is evident from what I have already diſcours'd; for if it cannot make one Church, it cannot cure the Schiſm; where there are two diſtinct and ſeparate Churches, which are not Members of each other, there is a Schiſm; for Church-Unity conſiſts in one Communion, as I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved in the Defence.<note place="margin">Defence, chap. 4.</note> Should Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Materials for Union be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Act of Parliament, it would be neither better nor worſe, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Univerſal, or a limited Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (as they can agree that matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves) eſtabliſhed by Law. Nay, ſhould ſuch an Act declare, that all ſuch ſeparate Churches ſhould be parts of the National Church; the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Parliaments may certainly alter the ſignification of words, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter the Nature of things. They
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:93053:237"/>would ſtill be as many Churches as they are now, but could never be one Church, though they might be called a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church, as that may be made to ſignifie all the Churches of profeſſed Chriſtians in the Nation eſtabliſhed by Law. Such an Act of Parliament would deliver the Diſſenters from temporal Puniſhments, and might deliver them from the ſin of Diſobedience to Civil Governors; but the guilt of Schiſm will remain ſtill, unleſs he thinks, that the Donatiſts were not Schiſmaticks, when <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate with an uniting Deſign, granted a general Toleration. So that this Project may ſecure the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, but cannot ſecure the Souls of Diſſenters; Schiſm will damn men, though they ſhould get it eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament; but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and I, I perceive, have very different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and therefore no wonder, if our Materials for Union differ: He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for this World, I am concerned for the next. He would ſecure Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from all Trouble and Moleſtation here, which I am by no means againſt, as far as it may be done, with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Church and State, and honour of Religion; but if it were in
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:93053:238"/>my Power, I would Sacrifice my eaſe and quiet, and all that is dear to me in this World, to ſecure their immortal Intereſts, which no humane Power can ſecure, while they live in Schiſm.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> thinks, he has found out a device to cure the Schiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>it ſhould be decreed in the Convocation, that neither Church ſhould un-church one another.</hi> This is a wonderful Power he gives to the Decree of a Convocation; that Churches, which ſeparate from each others Communion, yet ſhall not un-church one another. For what does he mean by <hi>un-churching?</hi> To aſſert the Communion of any Church to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unlawful, I think, is to un-church it, that is, to make it no Church to us; and whoever ſeparates from any Church, though he be never ſo ſilent, does by his Separation, either condemn the Communion of that Church to be unlawful, or condemn himſelf of Schiſm, for nothing can juſtifie a Separation, but ſinful terms of Communion. How is it poſſible then, that two Churches, which ſeparate from each other, ſhould not un-church one another, or un-church themſelves. There is but one Church, and one Communion, and
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:93053:238"/>therefore where there are two ſeparate Churches, and two Communions, they cannot both be true Catholick Churches; and Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s contrivance to declare theſe ſeparate Churches, to be all true Catholick Churches by the Decree of Convocation, is like his Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make all the ſeparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Churches one National Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Project is not a very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way, ſo much as to preſerve the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Peace and Union of the Nation; and if it be not good for this, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly good for nothing. We ſee, how troubled and diſturbed the State of the Nation is at this day, occaſioned by the Diſputes of Religion; how envenomed their Spirits are, how furious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious their Zeal; now not to enlarge upon this unpleaſant Theme, which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may be called railing; I would only ask Mr. <hi>H.</hi> whether ſuch an Act of Parliament, as he dreams of, would heal any differences in Religion, would make the Diſſenters think better of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than now they do? Would make them more Loyal in their Principles, more Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to one another, more cool and temperate in their Zeal? Whether ſuch
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:93053:239"/>an Act could ſet bounds to the ſeveral Sects among us, and make them content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their own private Perſwaſions, and with the Liberties and Priviledges, which the Law grants them, without encroaching upon their Neighbours, or affecting Rule and Dominion, and uſing all imaginable Arts to make Proſelytes, and enlarge their Party? This is the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of all our Diſturbance now, and what hope is there, when the Cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that the Effect will ceaſe? If men ſtill have the ſame fondneſs for their own Opinions and Churches, the ſame Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to others, the ſame Zeal to promote a Party; if ſtill they think themſelves as much bound as ever, to advance the Cauſe of God, and to ſet Chriſt on his Throne, according to their old pretence, how fond is it to imagine, that we ſhall enjoy more Peace and Security, than we do now?</p>
               <p>If it be anſwered, that the Diſſenters are at preſent uneaſie and troubleſom, becauſe the Laws are againſt them, and they are in conſtant danger of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, to the loſs of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the impoveriſhing their Families, but if they had the ſame favour, and the ſame ſecurity from the Government, as
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:93053:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>others have, they would be as quiet and peaceable, and as dutiful Subjects, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are. I reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It does not ſeem very probable, that thoſe, who are ſo Inſolent, Daring, and Factious, when the Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are againſt them, ſhould grow modeſt and governable, when the Law is on their ſide. If they cannot be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned with the Bridle in their mouths, it is hard truſting to their good Nature.</p>
               <p>For, 2. We have had ſufficient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, how buſie, turbulent, and factious the Spirit of <hi>Fanaticiſm</hi> has always been, and we ſee no Symptoms of their chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for the better.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We know by experience, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibly it is to oblige theſe men by any favours. The kindneſs and moderation of Government is always thought a juſt debt to their great merit and deſert, or the effect of fear and weakneſs, or the over-ruling Power of God, who turns the hearts of Governors to favour his People, even againſt their own Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore no thanks is due to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe men never yet let ſlip an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and opportunity to diſturb Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or to ſerve their Cauſe. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:93053:240"/>thing, that is granted them, gives them only a new confidence to ask and to demand more. And if ever they can ſtand upon equal ground with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they will as boldly challenge a Superiority, and be as much diſobliged, if they be denyed. If once they get a legal Rite to their Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, they will next demand the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Tythes too, and declaim againſt the Magiſtrates as Sacrilegious Uſurpers, if they be denyed. Their Diſcipline will not long be confined within their own Conventicles, will reach Biſhops and Princes too, whoſe Authority ſhall be no longer owned, than they ſubmit to the Scepter of Chriſt. Theſe things are not yet forgot among us, and I ſuppoſe, it will be hard to perſwade any Prince to make a ſecond Experiment, when he paid ſo dear for the firſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We have made a ſad Experiment already, how tame and gentle Diſſenters prove, when the reſtraints of Laws are gone. When the Church of <hi>England</hi> was diſſolved, and the encloſures flung open, and every man did as he liſt, there was no more Peace, than there is now, only inſtead of railing at the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they railed at one another. But enough of this.</p>
               <pb n="463" facs="tcp:93053:240"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> thinks all this will be prevented by his Epiſcopal Viſiters, who are to ſee, <hi>that the Churches of both ſorts walk according to their own Order, and the Peace of one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, 1. Who ſhall undertake, that all theſe Churches ſhall quietly ſubmit to theſe Viſiters, and quietly obey their Orders, any more than they do to the Viſitation of their Ordinaries now? And what means of Union is there left, if they don't?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Who ſhall undertake, that theſe Viſiters themſelves ſhall not prove factious and partial, and ſecretly foment, inſtead of ſuppreſſing Diſputes and Quarrels between the Churches, for the Viſiters are to be of all ſorts too, as well as the Churches; <hi>Independent, Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Viſiters, by the name of the King's Biſhops, or Eccleſiaſtical Officers? now I doubt Epiſcopal Churches would find no great comfort in the Viſitation of ſuch <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Viſiters, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> I confeſs for my own part, I ſhould not much care to come under their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation. And I will not anſwer for all Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Viſiters, that they ſhall always carry an equal hand to Diſſenters. As for Inſtance.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays, <hi>That no Members of either Church ſhould depart from one Church to another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſufficient peaceable Reaſon.</hi> Now who muſt be Judge of this, but the Viſiter? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then, a Member of a Presbyterian Church think fit to return to the Epiſcopal Church, do you think, that a Presbyterian Viſiter will be caſily ſatisfied, that he has a peaceable and ſufficient Reaſon for this? Will not every Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiter
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:93053:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>be greatly enclined to favour and enlarge the Communion of that Church, to which he himſelf belongs? And what Quarrels is this like to occaſion between the ſeveral Churches? It may be much greater, than any thing elſe has yet done.</p>
               <p>But the great Tryal of Skill will be in the promoting of theſe Viſiters. For though the King have the Nomination and Appointment of them, their Ordination being only a broad Seal (a new way of Conſecrating Biſhops) yet what Art will be uſed by the different Churches in the Dioceſs, to get a Viſiter of their own Communion? What a task will the King have to pleaſe all theſe ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts? What a noiſe and clamour will the Diſſenters raiſe (who know how to take eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion for that) if they have not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Viſiter? Nay, it will not be enough then, that he is a Diſſenter in general, but he muſt be a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> Diſſenter, according to the Intereſts of theſe ſeveral Churches. This will be a perpetual occaſion of Quarrel, and every Party will think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves injured and diſobliged, who have not a Viſiter of their own Communion.</p>
               <p>Theſe are Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Materials for Union, and if Princes and Parliaments think fit to make the Experiment, I cannot help it. But I will venture to turn Prophet for once, and foretel, that they will ſoon find Reaſon to repent the Experiment.</p>
